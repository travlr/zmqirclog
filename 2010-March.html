<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:49:01] &lt;davelee&gt;  ok, that&#8217;s the part which confused me. I ran ruby local_lat.rb <a class="reference external" href="tcp://127.0.0.1:5555">tcp://127.0.0.1:5555</a> 1 100</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:49:32] &lt;davelee&gt;  yep rgr</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:51:27] &lt;davelee&gt;  ok, that seemed to work; local_thr.rb closed with a message about throughput; remote_thr.rb remains running</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:51:45] &lt;sustrik&gt;  yup</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:53:09] &lt;davelee&gt;  so ... are there any other examples of how to actually use the ruby gem ?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:53:34] &lt;davelee&gt;  the amqp gem is a bit arcane but reasonably easy to figure out by looking at the examples</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:53:54] &lt;davelee&gt;  zmq gem has these perf scripts, and i&#8217;ve got a basic idea from looking at them</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:54:48] &lt;davelee&gt;  oh right, time to look &#64; the C bindings ...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:55:56] &lt;davelee&gt;  in that case,  I&#8217;ll assume there&#8217;s not yet a higher-level ruby library - it&#8217;s just a wrapper around the C libs?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:56:47] &lt;davelee&gt;  anyway, gotta go. thanks for the help</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:05:11] &lt;mato&gt; sustrik: take a look at my proposals regarding MSG_MORE when you get a moment</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:05:33] &lt;mato&gt; sustrik: i think they are nice and consistent</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:07:30] &lt;pquerna&gt;  hi, for $work we use lots of txAMQP and rabbitmq, but am unhappy with various parts.  I&#8217;m trying to gork zmq, but really it seems to just be a transport layer, abit a cool one that abstracts more than most tcp based transports.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:07:51] &lt;pquerna&gt;  It seems hinted at that you need to build your own mechnisims for configuration management and distribution of how to communicate between machines</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:08:28] &lt;pquerna&gt;  is this something zmq intends to do more of, I mean I look at for example <a class="reference external" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_queue.html">http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_queue.html</a> , and it makes me feel like those more higher level services just don&#8217;t exist yet?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:09:01] &lt;mato&gt; pquerna: the device implementations do exist, but they&#8217;re still considered early days, so are not documented</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:09:41] &lt;mato&gt; pquerna: however, there are people using e.g. zmq_queue to successfully implement shared queues</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:10:23] &lt;mato&gt; and yes, zmq devices are something that we will be focusing on</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:12:20] &lt;pquerna&gt;  okay, and what about the brokerless design &#8211; i read throguh <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:brokerless">http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:brokerless</a> and yeha, I&#8217;ve done this before with my own wire format about 2 jobs back :) but doesn&#8217;t seem like there are bits on the open source side of zmq that do it yet (?)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:14] &lt;pquerna&gt;  or rather, its left as an exercise to the reader...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:28] &lt;mato&gt; well, it depends on what you <em>need</em> from the broker</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:59] &lt;mato&gt; all the bits are in place, and if you look at recent discussion on the mailing list, you&#8217;ll see that there is talk of embedding devices inside applications</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:25] &lt;mato&gt; so instead of zmq_queue being a binary, it&#8217;s a call to e.g. zmq_queue_device(...) inside your app</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:39] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ah</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:49] &lt;mato&gt; which means that you decide where your &#8220;broker&#8221; bits go, if you need them</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:15:12] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ya, we have a mix of use cases, some of them definately could use somehting as simple as that.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:15:35] &lt;pquerna&gt;  most of ours are either single writer, lots of readers, or single reader, lots of writers, both of which can fit that just fine.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:16:30] &lt;mato&gt; yep, and you can probably do a lot of that without any devices at all</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:16:46] &lt;mato&gt; since 0mq sockets let you talk to multiple endpoints</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:17:05] &lt;mato&gt; take a look at the zmq_socket documentation, it describes the messaging patterns you can use</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:17:30] &lt;mato&gt; (yes, it&#8217;s terse, but it&#8217;s a reference so you should get the idea)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:18:09] &lt;mato&gt; you might also want to skim the LWN article if you haven&#8217;t read it already</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:08] &lt;pquerna&gt;  one thing I don&#8217;t quite understand is error handling, say in the simplest case of a p2p tcp connection &#8211; how much does zmq retry underneath, is there any way to hook in my own logging subsystem to say &#8216;hey tcp ain&#8217;t working to host xxx&#8217;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:30] &lt;mato&gt; no there isn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s kind of deliberate</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:55] &lt;mato&gt; since even with tcp you don&#8217;t get a real/instant notification of e.g. &#8220;the other end went away&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:59] &lt;pquerna&gt;  sure</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:20:06] &lt;pquerna&gt;  (unless you wait for a reply)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:20:09] &lt;mato&gt; precisely</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:01] &lt;mato&gt; which you can also do with 0mq, but the point is that a 0mq socket lets you access an asynchronous queue</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:29] &lt;pquerna&gt;  right, we just do lots of... multi-data center stuff on cloud servers.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:34] &lt;pquerna&gt;  the network can.. be... sucky.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:55] &lt;mato&gt; so you want to detect and respond to that suckiness somehow?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:57] &lt;mato&gt; right?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:57] &lt;pquerna&gt;  also I guess no native encryption.. so vpn/ipsec everything?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:14] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ya, at least log it a bit, ideally we switch whcih endpoint we are using</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:37] &lt;mato&gt; no encryption, so yes, vpn/ipsec... designing good encryption is hard and vpn/ipsec is proven and understood</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:43] &lt;mato&gt; we try not to reinvent the wheel</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:56] &lt;pquerna&gt;  :)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:10] &lt;mato&gt; as for detecting the network...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:28] &lt;mato&gt; what i would suggest is a side channel / monitoring messages using 0mq</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:41] &lt;mato&gt; so you periodically ping the other end and test latency</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:24:22] &lt;mato&gt; and if you start getting bad figures back your application can take evasive action/start paging netops people/whatever...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:10] &lt;pquerna&gt;  thanks for answering all my questions</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:21] &lt;mato&gt; also, flow control (high/low water mark) on sockets has been implemented in 0mq</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:37] &lt;pquerna&gt;  yes, thank goodness</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:59] &lt;pquerna&gt;  i actually want a mode where it throws away exploding queues, but meh</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:27:00] &lt;mato&gt; so that can also be used to good effect and may be enough for some applications</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:54] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think the main thing that i know understand is that ZMQ isn&#8217;t really a messaging system but an awesome socket implementation on which you can build your own MS.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:34] &lt;sustrik&gt;  it depends on the exact meaning of &#8220;messaging system&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the problem is that the terminology is pretty vague</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:37] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so what we thought of was ditching all the &#8220;messaging middleware&#8221; terminology on the front page</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  and instead presenting what you can do with the product</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  something like:</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:06] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I completely agree with that.  The problem with my specific case is, that I started looking at ZMQ after i read about a comparison on the SecondLife wiki, it is different than RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;  yup, but the difference is hard to explain, we&#8217;ve been struggling with explaining it for years</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:06] &lt;sustrik&gt;  i mean, explaining it in 1-2 paragrahs on the frontpage</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:38] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so that all kinds of people that come to the website get at least a dim idea of what the hell is it about</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:16:53] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think a good analogy would be that where ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ gives you a post office, ZMQ gives you couriers. While being lightweight and fast you do need to take care of them yourself.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:35] &lt;sustrik&gt;  hm, makes sense</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:55] &lt;sustrik&gt;  what about &#8220;a new layer of Internet stack&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  + a picture showing Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and 0MQ on top of that?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:24:56] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes that makes sense, i personally think of ZMQ as TCP/IP covered in sugar. All the flexibility without the headaches.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:25:52] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think it makes a perfect combination with high level languages such as Python.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:36:42] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I really think it is important to stress the level at which ZMQ operates.

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:03] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  well, sharing sockets between threads isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re supposed to do with zmq</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:29] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  at any rate, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:41] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  have a single thread that handles all messages on a single socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:45] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  and delegate to worker processes</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:42:12] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  that, or spawn one socket per thread</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:43:43] &lt;engwan&gt;    hmm.. but i tried just spawning one thread.. and it still segfaults</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:01] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  hmmm, if the thread is different than the one that created the socket, you may still have issues</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:08] &lt;engwan&gt;    my loader forks/execs then creates the socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:12] &lt;engwan&gt;    then segfault</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:15] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  ohhhhhhhhhh</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:19] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  there&#8217;s your problem</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:23] &lt;engwan&gt;    but if i do it directly</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:25] &lt;engwan&gt;    without fork</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:27] &lt;engwan&gt;    it works</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, exactly</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:41] &lt;pieterh&gt;   sockets are not thread safe</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:42] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  I&#8217;ve found that requiring ffi-rzmq before forking does not work</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:52] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  so, don&#8217;t require ffi-rzmq till after you&#8217;ve forked</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:06] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  each process will need its own context anyway</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  still, you should have one socket per thread</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  or just have an IO dedicated thread that handles a single socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:46:05] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you can even use eventmachine for that with em-zeromq</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:46:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  though, I with a low number of sockets there&#8217;s not much benefit</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:50:08] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  pieterh: does that advice make sense for you? Would you go one socket per worker, or just spawn a single thread reading off the sock and delegating to workers</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:50:16] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  in a multi-threaded up</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:52:18] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  I tend to think inproc isn&#8217;t so good in ruby, as there&#8217;s a serialization cost. In C you can just stuff a struct in one, in ruby you have to serialize/deserialize</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:52:32] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, each thread handles a separate HTTP request using rails</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:13] &lt;pieterh&gt;   engwan: ok, so give each thread its own context</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:43] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  i mean, as I understand it, ZMQ will round-robin requests to various workers</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  so you want the workers pulling work, not getting it pushed to them, ideally</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:04] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  ah, cool, glad I could help</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:35] &lt;engwan&gt;    yeah, im not pushing work to the workers, rather the workers themselves connect to mongrel2 and ask for work</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:41] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you could either use the router/dealer stuff for that, or the easy way would be just to use a ruby construct to pull the work</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, I&#8217;m not nuts about that part of mongrel2</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:01] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  since it uses a PUSH socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:06] &lt;engwan&gt;    i created the context after forking</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:13] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  PUSH has no backpressure right pieter?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:16] &lt;pieterh&gt;   so as far as zeromq is concerned, this should all be safe</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:21] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  so, a slow worker will get equal work, correct</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:48] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, so engwan, I think that&#8217;s kind of a design deficiency in mongrel2</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:56:02] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  in that a slow worker will queue messages, even while others are free</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:56:16] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you could mitigate this in your handler by implementing your own global queue</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:56:46] &lt;pieterh&gt;   what mongrel2 should use is the LRU queue pattern</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:57:01] &lt;engwan&gt;    oh, so these workers listen to the socket and receive zeromq messages, plainly round robin?</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:13:35] &lt;cremes&gt;    so, i think i found the problem; it requires a change to an api &#8216;contract&#8217; in ffi-rzmq</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:14:17] &lt;cremes&gt;    right now when you call #send it handles calling Message#close for you</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:14:42] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  oh, interesting</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:15:00] &lt;cremes&gt;    zmqmachine has a #send_messages method that automatically sets the right flags for multi-part messages, etc</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:17:22] &lt;cremes&gt;    take a look at the logic for #write:  <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/859387">https://gist.github.com/859387</a></div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:17:47] &lt;cremes&gt;    if the call to send_messages returns a failure, it keeps the messages on the internal queue and</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:09] &lt;cremes&gt;    tries to resend them in 10ms</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:33] &lt;cremes&gt;    however, the only way this would fail is if at least one part of a multi-part message failed</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:55] &lt;cremes&gt;    but any parts <em>before</em> that one already had Message#close called on them</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:19:25] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  how does one part of a multipart fail?</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:19:30] &lt;cremes&gt;    i don&#8217;t know</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:20:14] &lt;cremes&gt;    regardless, changing the contract for Socket#send moves the api a little closer back to the C version</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:32:09] &lt;andrewvc&gt; it looks like exceptions that don&#8217;t get handled cause mutex to complain that it now won&#8217;t get unlocked.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:36:29] &lt;andrewvc&gt; basically, here&#8217;s the deal</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:38:32] &lt;andrewvc&gt; then lets say you try and resend the message, starting from part 1</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:00] &lt;andrewvc&gt; well, #send has modified those Message objects, they&#8217;ve been closed, so you can&#8217;t resend part 1 and 2</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:06] &lt;andrewvc&gt; you have to recreate the Message objects</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:23] &lt;andrewvc&gt; what you really want to do is send all 4, then close all 4, not send each, closing them one at a time as you go</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:29] &lt;engwan&gt;   ohh.. yeah, that makes sense..</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:55] &lt;andrewvc&gt; though, something still seems odd about it to me, maybe there&#8217;s a better way</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:40:10] &lt;andrewvc&gt; though, the other thing we discussed was renaming send, as it conflicts with Object#send</div>

Is it possible to implement zeromq as native library in some language and not as language bindings? i.e. implement zero-mq protocol on top of wrapped sockets.

<div class="line">[Thursday 10 March 2011] [11:47:59] &lt;pieterh&gt; and you instead create a much larger design and complexity cost</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 10 March 2011] [11:48:02] &lt;cremes&gt;  the log server, which handles writing the messages to persistent storage, has a sub socket</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:39:20] &lt;cremes&gt;  nadime: i have a few suggestions for things to look at</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:39:52] &lt;cremes&gt;  1. if your PUSH socket is in the same process as your &#8220;io thread PULL sockets&#8221; you should be using inproc transport instead of tcp</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:40:16] &lt;cremes&gt;  2. take a look at your message serialization; sometimes deserialization is more costly than serialization</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:40:38] &lt;cremes&gt;  however, i assume you are sending packed structures so you are probably just casting a pointer to get to your data</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:41:21] &lt;cremes&gt;  3. instrument your messages so that you can measure how many nano/micro/milliseconds it takes for the PUSH to deliver to the PULL socket</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:42:14] &lt;cremes&gt;  4. instrument the messages that go from the &#8220;server io threads&#8221; to the &#8220;client io threads&#8221; via PUB/SUB to measure latency</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:04:32] &lt;nadime&gt;  i am using inproc for anything local, cremes</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:04:42] &lt;nadime&gt;  the only thing i use tcp for is external</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:05:41] &lt;nadime&gt;  thanks for the suggestions, re: instrumentation</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:53:46] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      well, sustrik if not I was just wondering if you have considered the use of a pipe... I&#8217;ve used them in the past, and one nice thing about them is that a non-blocking pipe write (up to a defined limit) is atomic, it either goes trough entirely or fail, whihc I feel is what the current problem was with making sockets non-blocking...</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:55:26] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      POSIX.1-2001  says  that write(2)s of less than PIPE_BUF bytes must be atomic: the output data is written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence. [...] O_NONBLOCK enabled, n &lt;= PIPE_BUF: If there is room to write n bytes to the pipe, then write(2) succeeds immediately, writing all n bytes; otherwise write(2) fails, with errno set to EAGAIN.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:56:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;   dermoth: is pipe different from a socket pair in this respect?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:58:53] &lt;sustrik&gt;   the nice thing at least is that pipe is unidirectional rather than bidrectional</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:59:07] &lt;sustrik&gt;   meaning it will consume less buffer memory</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:59:16] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      sustrik, I have little experience with sockets, but afaik a non-blocking write can he partial and there&#8217;s no threshold for atomicity. OTOH  POSIX.1-2001 says that anything less than or equal to PIPE_BUF must be written atomically. IIRC it also defines PIPE_BUF be at least 512 bytes, iirc in Linux it&#8217;s 4096 though...</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [03:00:45] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      as with above, from &#8220;man 7 pipe&#8221; on Ubuntu: POSIX.1-2001 requires PIPE_BUF to be at least 512 bytes.  (On Linux, PIPE_BUF  is  4096 bytes.)</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 15 March 2011] [22:43:47] &lt;Honeyman&gt; Hello. I am using PyZMQ, and trying to do the REQ-REP communication, polling for the replies with the zmq.core.poll.select(), using timeout = 5.0 (seconds). But most of the times, this call returns immediately, without waiting for 5 seconds, returning empty lists, like if the socket is not available.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 15 March 2011] [22:47:19] &lt;Honeyman&gt; What could be the reason of this problem? A bug in the PyZMQ? If pyzmq&#8217;s select() is using zmq_poll(), maybe it is zmq_poll who returns prematurely, not complying to the timeouts?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 18 March 2011] [04:13:19] &lt;mikko&gt;     i can prepare it for master as well</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 18 March 2011] [04:13:27] &lt;mikko&gt;     i think it should&#8217;ve gone to master first</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 18 March 2011] [04:14:03] &lt;sustrik&gt;   with new development i would assume you are right</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 18 March 2011] [04:14:18] &lt;sustrik&gt;   with bugfixes the direction is opposite sometimes</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 18 March 2011] [04:14:36] &lt;sustrik&gt;   ie. stable version is fixed, then the fix is upstreamed to master (dev)</div>
