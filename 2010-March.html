<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:24:56] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes that makes sense, i personally think of ZMQ as TCP/IP covered in sugar. All the flexibility without the headaches.</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:31:09] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  So that appthread does in no way limit the amount of sockets i can open is my real question i think.</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:45] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  ZMQ is really nice, did some benchmarks its really fast</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  we&#8217;ve tried :)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:41:49] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I also love the design of the website and the documentation. But it took me some time to understand the level at which ZMQ operates, which is pretty low compared to other messaging systems. But, really like it for that.</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:48:33] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  i&#8217;ll give it some thought and might get back to it on the mailing list</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:03] &lt;sustrik&gt;  sjampoo: thanks</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:54] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think the main thing that i know understand is that ZMQ isn&#8217;t really a messaging system but an awesome socket implementation on which you can build your own MS.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:34] &lt;sustrik&gt;  it depends on the exact meaning of &#8220;messaging system&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the problem is that the terminology is pretty vague</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:37] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so what we thought of was ditching all the &#8220;messaging middleware&#8221; terminology on the front page</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  and instead presenting what you can do with the product</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  something like:</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;  &#8220;write a server in 10 lines of code&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:06] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I completely agree with that.  The problem with my specific case is, that I started looking at ZMQ after i read about a comparison on the SecondLife wiki, it is different than RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;  yup, but the difference is hard to explain, we&#8217;ve been struggling with explaining it for years</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:06] &lt;sustrik&gt;  i mean, explaining it in 1-2 paragrahs on the frontpage</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:38] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so that all kinds of people that come to the website get at least a dim idea of what the hell is it about</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:15:35] Quit   thehelix has left this server (Ping timeout: 276 seconds).</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:16:53] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think a good analogy would be that where ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ gives you a post office, ZMQ gives you couriers. While being lightweight and fast you do need to take care of them yourself.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:35] &lt;sustrik&gt;  hm, makes sense</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:55] &lt;sustrik&gt;  what about &#8220;a new layer of Internet stack&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  + a picture showing Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and 0MQ on top of that?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:24:56] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes that makes sense, i personally think of ZMQ as TCP/IP covered in sugar. All the flexibility without the headaches.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:25:52] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think it makes a perfect combination with high level languages such as Python.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:36:42] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I really think it is important to stress the level at which ZMQ operates. I remember that i read the article: &#8216;broker vs brokerless&#8217; a while ago and after finishing it started looking for broker/directory service options.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:37:08] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Now that i understand what ZMQ provides and doesn&#8217;t provide it makes sense.</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:28] &lt;mato&gt; well, it depends on what you <em>need</em> from the broker</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:25] &lt;mato&gt; so instead of zmq_queue being a binary, it&#8217;s a call to e.g. zmq_queue_device(...) inside your app</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:45] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  ZMQ is really nice, did some benchmarks its really fast</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:41:49] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I also love the design of the website and the documentation. But it took me some time to understand the level at which ZMQ operates, which is pretty low compared to other messaging systems. But, really like it for that.</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:48:33] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  i&#8217;ll give it some thought and might get back to it on the mailing list</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:03] &lt;sustrik&gt;  sjampoo: thanks</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:54] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think the main thing that i know understand is that ZMQ isn&#8217;t really a messaging system but an awesome socket implementation on which you can build your own MS.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:34] &lt;sustrik&gt;  it depends on the exact meaning of &#8220;messaging system&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the problem is that the terminology is pretty vague</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:37] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so what we thought of was ditching all the &#8220;messaging middleware&#8221; terminology on the front page</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  and instead presenting what you can do with the product</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  something like:</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;  &#8220;write a server in 10 lines of code&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:06] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I completely agree with that.  The problem with my specific case is, that I started looking at ZMQ after i read about a comparison on the SecondLife wiki, it is different than RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;  yup, but the difference is hard to explain, we&#8217;ve been struggling with explaining it for years</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:06] &lt;sustrik&gt;  i mean, explaining it in 1-2 paragrahs on the frontpage</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:38] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so that all kinds of people that come to the website get at least a dim idea of what the hell is it about</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:15:35] Quit   thehelix has left this server (Ping timeout: 276 seconds).</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:16:53] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think a good analogy would be that where ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ gives you a post office, ZMQ gives you couriers. While being lightweight and fast you do need to take care of them yourself.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:35] &lt;sustrik&gt;  hm, makes sense</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:55] &lt;sustrik&gt;  what about &#8220;a new layer of Internet stack&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  + a picture showing Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and 0MQ on top of that?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:24:56] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes that makes sense, i personally think of ZMQ as TCP/IP covered in sugar. All the flexibility without the headaches.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:25:52] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think it makes a perfect combination with high level languages such as Python.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:36:42] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I really think it is important to stress the level at which ZMQ operates. I remember that i read the article: &#8216;broker vs brokerless&#8217; a while ago and after finishing it started looking for broker/directory service options.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:37:08] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Now that i understand what ZMQ provides and doesn&#8217;t provide it makes sense.</div>
