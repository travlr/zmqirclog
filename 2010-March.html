<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:55:56] &lt;davelee&gt;  in that case,  I&#8217;ll assume there&#8217;s not yet a higher-level ruby library - it&#8217;s just a wrapper around the C libs?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [02:56:47] &lt;davelee&gt;  anyway, gotta go. thanks for the help</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:05:11] &lt;mato&gt; sustrik: take a look at my proposals regarding MSG_MORE when you get a moment</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:05:33] &lt;mato&gt; sustrik: i think they are nice and consistent</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:07:30] &lt;pquerna&gt;  hi, for $work we use lots of txAMQP and rabbitmq, but am unhappy with various parts.  I&#8217;m trying to gork zmq, but really it seems to just be a transport layer, abit a cool one that abstracts more than most tcp based transports.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:07:51] &lt;pquerna&gt;  It seems hinted at that you need to build your own mechnisims for configuration management and distribution of how to communicate between machines</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:08:28] &lt;pquerna&gt;  is this something zmq intends to do more of, I mean I look at for example <a class="reference external" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_queue.html">http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_queue.html</a> , and it makes me feel like those more higher level services just don&#8217;t exist yet?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:09:01] &lt;mato&gt; pquerna: the device implementations do exist, but they&#8217;re still considered early days, so are not documented</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:09:41] &lt;mato&gt; pquerna: however, there are people using e.g. zmq_queue to successfully implement shared queues</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:10:23] &lt;mato&gt; and yes, zmq devices are something that we will be focusing on</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:12:20] &lt;pquerna&gt;  okay, and what about the brokerless design &#8211; i read throguh <a class="reference external" href="http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:brokerless">http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:brokerless</a> and yeha, I&#8217;ve done this before with my own wire format about 2 jobs back :) but doesn&#8217;t seem like there are bits on the open source side of zmq that do it yet (?)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:14] &lt;pquerna&gt;  or rather, its left as an exercise to the reader...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:28] &lt;mato&gt; well, it depends on what you <em>need</em> from the broker</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:13:59] &lt;mato&gt; all the bits are in place, and if you look at recent discussion on the mailing list, you&#8217;ll see that there is talk of embedding devices inside applications</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:25] &lt;mato&gt; so instead of zmq_queue being a binary, it&#8217;s a call to e.g. zmq_queue_device(...) inside your app</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:39] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ah</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:14:49] &lt;mato&gt; which means that you decide where your &#8220;broker&#8221; bits go, if you need them</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:15:12] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ya, we have a mix of use cases, some of them definately could use somehting as simple as that.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:15:35] &lt;pquerna&gt;  most of ours are either single writer, lots of readers, or single reader, lots of writers, both of which can fit that just fine.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:16:30] &lt;mato&gt; yep, and you can probably do a lot of that without any devices at all</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:16:46] &lt;mato&gt; since 0mq sockets let you talk to multiple endpoints</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:17:05] &lt;mato&gt; take a look at the zmq_socket documentation, it describes the messaging patterns you can use</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:08] &lt;pquerna&gt;  one thing I don&#8217;t quite understand is error handling, say in the simplest case of a p2p tcp connection &#8211; how much does zmq retry underneath, is there any way to hook in my own logging subsystem to say &#8216;hey tcp ain&#8217;t working to host xxx&#8217;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:30] &lt;mato&gt; no there isn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s kind of deliberate</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:55] &lt;mato&gt; since even with tcp you don&#8217;t get a real/instant notification of e.g. &#8220;the other end went away&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:19:59] &lt;pquerna&gt;  sure</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:20:09] &lt;mato&gt; precisely</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:01] &lt;mato&gt; which you can also do with 0mq, but the point is that a 0mq socket lets you access an asynchronous queue</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:29] &lt;pquerna&gt;  right, we just do lots of... multi-data center stuff on cloud servers.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:34] &lt;pquerna&gt;  the network can.. be... sucky.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:55] &lt;mato&gt; so you want to detect and respond to that suckiness somehow?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:57] &lt;mato&gt; right?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:21:57] &lt;pquerna&gt;  also I guess no native encryption.. so vpn/ipsec everything?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:14] &lt;pquerna&gt;  ya, at least log it a bit, ideally we switch whcih endpoint we are using</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:22:37] &lt;mato&gt; no encryption, so yes, vpn/ipsec... designing good encryption is hard and vpn/ipsec is proven and understood</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:10] &lt;mato&gt; as for detecting the network...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:28] &lt;mato&gt; what i would suggest is a side channel / monitoring messages using 0mq</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:23:41] &lt;mato&gt; so you periodically ping the other end and test latency</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:24:22] &lt;mato&gt; and if you start getting bad figures back your application can take evasive action/start paging netops people/whatever...</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:10] &lt;pquerna&gt;  thanks for answering all my questions</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:21] &lt;mato&gt; also, flow control (high/low water mark) on sockets has been implemented in 0mq</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [05:26:59] &lt;pquerna&gt;  i actually want a mode where it throws away exploding queues, but meh</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:29:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;  or green threads</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:29:55] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:29:58] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Green Threads</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:30:01] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Tasklets really</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:30:27] &lt;sustrik&gt;  afaik all python green threads map to a single OS thread</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:30:38] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so specify 1</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:30:42] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Ok.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:31:09] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  So that appthread does in no way limit the amount of sockets i can open is my real question i think.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:31:48] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  (I mean the appthread setting to zmq_init)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:33:53] &lt;sustrik&gt;  no, it&#8217;s just number of threads</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:33:59] &lt;sustrik&gt;  even if you have 1 thread</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  you can open 1000 sockets</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:23] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  ok thanks for clearing that up for me</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:45] &lt;sustrik&gt;  np</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:45] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  ZMQ is really nice, did some benchmarks its really fast</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:34:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  we&#8217;ve tried :)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:41:49] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I also love the design of the website and the documentation. But it took me some time to understand the level at which ZMQ operates, which is pretty low compared to other messaging systems. But, really like it for that.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:46:59] &lt;sustrik&gt;  sjampoo: if you have any suggestion how to organise the documentation better</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:47:12] &lt;sustrik&gt;  give us a hint</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:47:37] &lt;sustrik&gt;  what kind of info would you have preferred to see first?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:47:39] &lt;sustrik&gt;  etc.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:48:33] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  i&#8217;ll give it some thought and might get back to it on the mailing list</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:03] &lt;sustrik&gt;  sjampoo: thanks</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:49:54] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think the main thing that i know understand is that ZMQ isn&#8217;t really a messaging system but an awesome socket implementation on which you can build your own MS.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:34] &lt;sustrik&gt;  it depends on the exact meaning of &#8220;messaging system&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:51:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the problem is that the terminology is pretty vague</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:37] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so what we thought of was ditching all the &#8220;messaging middleware&#8221; terminology on the front page</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:52:52] &lt;sustrik&gt;  and instead presenting what you can do with the product</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  something like:</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:53:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;  &#8220;write a server in 10 lines of code&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:06] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I completely agree with that.  The problem with my specific case is, that I started looking at ZMQ after i read about a comparison on the SecondLife wiki, it is different than RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:54:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;  yup, but the difference is hard to explain, we&#8217;ve been struggling with explaining it for years</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:06] &lt;sustrik&gt;  i mean, explaining it in 1-2 paragrahs on the frontpage</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [08:55:38] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so that all kinds of people that come to the website get at least a dim idea of what the hell is it about</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:16:53] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think a good analogy would be that where ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ gives you a post office, ZMQ gives you couriers. While being lightweight and fast you do need to take care of them yourself.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:35] &lt;sustrik&gt;  hm, makes sense</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:21:55] &lt;sustrik&gt;  what about &#8220;a new layer of Internet stack&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  + a picture showing Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP and 0MQ on top of that?</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:24:56] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  yes that makes sense, i personally think of ZMQ as TCP/IP covered in sugar. All the flexibility without the headaches.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:25:52] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I think it makes a perfect combination with high level languages such as Python.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:36:42] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  I really think it is important to stress the level at which ZMQ operates. I remember that i read the article: &#8216;broker vs brokerless&#8217; a while ago and after finishing it started looking for broker/directory service options.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:37:08] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Now that i understand what ZMQ provides and doesn&#8217;t provide it makes sense.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [09:50:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  ok, i&#8217;ll try to improve the frontpage...</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [12:10:01] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  Hmm what is causing the huge interest spike in ZMQ at the moment? I see lots of people bookmarking it at delicious today and yesterday.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [12:14:09] &lt;sjampoo&gt;  ah, probably the &#8216;AMQP fundamentally flawed&#8217; article by Hintjes (which hit Hacker News)</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 31 March 2010] [12:16:03] &lt;squeeky&gt;  few people tweeted about it.</div>
