<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:56:20] &lt;sustrik&gt; what zmq_process?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:56:30] &lt;sustrik&gt; there&#8217;s no API change</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:56:37] &lt;sustrik&gt; ah, got it</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:57:09] &lt;sustrik&gt; you mean polling on 0MQ sockets using POSIX poll, right?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:57:45] &lt;sustrik&gt; yes, it&#8217;s missing, but actually, i&#8217;ve thought of better API in the meantime</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:57:56] &lt;sustrik&gt; the whole thing can be accomplished using 2 socket options</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:58:11] &lt;sustrik&gt; getsockopt (ZMQ_FD) would return an fd you can poll on</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:58:26] &lt;sustrik&gt; once it signals POLLIN, it means something happened with the socket</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:58:37] &lt;sustrik&gt; so you can do getsockopt (ZMQ_EVENTS)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [06:58:53] &lt;sustrik&gt; which would return a combination of ZMQ_POLLIN and ZMQ_POLLOUT</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:02:13] &lt;jugg&gt;    ZMQ_EVENTS currently does not yet exist?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:05:07] &lt;sustrik&gt; it does not, but feel free to add it</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:05:15] &lt;sustrik&gt; socket_base_t has two functions</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:05:35] &lt;sustrik&gt; has_in () and has_out ()</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:06:10] &lt;sustrik&gt; just call the two and return the result as the EVENTS socket option</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:08:33] &lt;jugg&gt;    ok, looks like that is in the current erlang bindings patch against zeromq.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [07:09:45] &lt;jugg&gt;    so if I understand correctly, the migrating socket between threads commit does away with the need for the zmq_process api addition.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [12:23:24] &lt;sd88g93&gt; one problem:  when i send double word size values, the same values dont appear on the recieving end.  All the examples ive tried before are limited to strings and work fine.  is there a special way to reconstruct  multibyte data types ?   note:  it is not an endian issue because i&#8217;m still working on localhost network.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [13:06:44] &lt;guido_g&gt; there is no way of de-/serializing of non-strings</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [13:34:29] &lt;sd88g93&gt; the client code is on top, server code on bottom</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [13:45:53] &lt;sd88g93&gt; but the code recieves a messsage, but interprets the cmd variable as zero, when i send it as 1</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [13:46:19] &lt;sd88g93&gt; no problem, i was just trying to make it simple case, didnt want to post too much</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [13:48:16] &lt;sd88g93&gt; only thing i can see different, is all the examples send char&#8217;s,  and i&#8217;m sending DWORD&#8217;s ,</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:00:03] &lt;cremes&gt;  sd88g93: i suggest reducing this case to the simplest thing possible; you have all sorts of commands and frames and everything else in there</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:00:13] &lt;cremes&gt;  there is a lot of code noise so it&#8217;s hard to zero in on the problem</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:00:22] &lt;sd88g93&gt; yeah, true</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:01:28] &lt;sd88g93&gt; one question though, when you send a uint32_t type, is the correct way to read the stream back into a variable by simply casting it to an uint32 ptr and dereferencing ?  or perhaps is there a better way ?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:02:14] &lt;cremes&gt;  sd88g93: i see a problem with line 103; since you are sending from a REQ to a XREP, the <em>first</em> message</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:02:18] &lt;cremes&gt;  you receive is the socket identity</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:02:37] &lt;cremes&gt;  so that&#8217;s probably why this is breaking</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:02:54] &lt;cremes&gt;  change it to a REP socket (which handles that socket identity stuff for you) and try again</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:03:57] &lt;cremes&gt;  you need to be really careful when using XREQ/XREP sockets because some of the 0mq magic doesn&#8217;t happen automatically anymore</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:05:23] &lt;sd88g93&gt; can i change the client socket to xreq ?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:07:33] &lt;cremes&gt;  sd88g93: sure</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:07:51] &lt;cremes&gt;  it will &#8220;silently&#8221; send the socket identity as the first message part</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:08:18] &lt;cremes&gt;  your xrep code needs to receive that message part first; then it can grab the cmd, nframes, hash, whatever</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:10:05] &lt;sd88g93&gt; how big is the socket identy ?   one byte ? 4 bytes ?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:11:33] &lt;cremes&gt;  it&#8217;s the first message part; it can be up to 255 bytes</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 13 July 2010] [14:12:20] &lt;sd88g93&gt; oh ok,  so i just recv the first, throw it away , then get the second part</div>

I was playing around with my own version of the butterfly example, and I found that when I killed one of the parallel workers, the other workers didn&#8217;t pick up the leftover work.

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:52:46] &lt;guido_g&gt;  i can guarantee that there&#8217;re none</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:58:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I was under the impression that the pgm and epgm protocols were using reliable multicast from OpenPGM. If so, then you&#8217;re going to have receipt, but not guaranteed delivery. If the listener isn&#8217;t on when the message is sent, then it&#8217;s going ot miss it.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:59:39] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   If you need really &#8220;once-and-only-once&#8221; delivery, then you need to have a queue where it tracks persistent subscriptions and persistent publishers and that&#8217;s a lot more work.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:00:27] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   So, from the sounds of it, I&#8217;d say the answer to your question is &#8220;Yes, you need to write that message tracking layer.&#8221;</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:29] &lt;jared___&gt; What I really need is a layer that can guarantee that once the application hands it a message to this layer, destined for a given endpoint, that the other endpoint will see them in order, and eventually.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:55] &lt;jared___&gt; I figured this was a guarantee not provided, since its pretty specific, but just wanted to make sure.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:04:26] &lt;jared___&gt; I am more interested in a pipe between two endpoints only, but the request-reply model seems like it has low performance.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:31] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Say the server is sending to the client. The client bounces, but while it&#8217;s down, the server has sent three messages. Do you need those three messages to be read by the client when it comes up?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:39] &lt;jared___&gt; But for your question, yes, I would expect the down servers to receive those messages.  But realistically in my case the connection would have been severed within 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:05] &lt;jared___&gt; Sorry, what I mean by that is that if the other end was truly disconnected, other mechanisms would have detected it, and this machine would then stop caring what messages made it through.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:15] &lt;jared___&gt; guido_g: what do you mean by numbers?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:43] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, if you need to see messages &#8220;in the past&#8221; then you need a queue that&#8217;s going to keep track of who has pulled off what message. Basically, a &#8220;message broker&#8221;. These are in a lot of systems, and don&#8217;t have to be a separate process. If you look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spread.org/">http://www.spread.org/</a> you&#8217;ll see something that uses a messaging system that might be more what you&#8217;re looking for.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:08:56] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Spread has the delivery guarantee. It&#8217;s also open source.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:06] &lt;guido_g&gt;  whereas spread also is not a _traditional_ broker based queueing system</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:39] &lt;guido_g&gt;  but the process has to be member of the group when the message is sent, afair</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:50] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed. Totally. And there are limitations to Spread. Which is why I&#8217;m here with ZeroMQ, but it does have the guaranteed delivery.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:39:05] &lt;guido_g&gt;  performance and delivery gurantees are contradictory in most cases</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:43:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed... if you need guarantees, then you need persistence of some kind. That costs time. Regardless of anything else.

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:52:46] &lt;guido_g&gt;  i can guarantee that there&#8217;re none</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:57:43] &lt;jared___&gt; I am determining whether or not an additional &#8216;message tracking&#8217; layer would need to be built on top of 0MQ, should I decide to use it.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:58:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I was under the impression that the pgm and epgm protocols were using reliable multicast from OpenPGM. If so, then you&#8217;re going to have receipt, but not guaranteed delivery. If the listener isn&#8217;t on when the message is sent, then it&#8217;s going ot miss it.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:59:39] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   If you need really &#8220;once-and-only-once&#8221; delivery, then you need to have a queue where it tracks persistent subscriptions and persistent publishers and that&#8217;s a lot more work.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:00:27] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   So, from the sounds of it, I&#8217;d say the answer to your question is &#8220;Yes, you need to write that message tracking layer.&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Then again, I&#8217;ve only been in this codebase for about 3 days now, but having been around the block a few times with other messaging systems, the pieces become very familiar.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:29] &lt;jared___&gt; What I really need is a layer that can guarantee that once the application hands it a message to this layer, destined for a given endpoint, that the other endpoint will see them in order, and eventually.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:55] &lt;jared___&gt; I figured this was a guarantee not provided, since its pretty specific, but just wanted to make sure.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:02:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, I&#8217;m going to ask a few &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; questions that will help me understand your requirements.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:03:03] &lt;jared___&gt; ok, sure.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:03:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Say you have a server and ten clients. When the server sends the first message, only five of those clients are up and listening. An hour later, the other five start up. When the second set start up, do they need to see that message that was sent an hour ago?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:04:26] &lt;jared___&gt; I am more interested in a pipe between two endpoints only, but the request-reply model seems like it has low performance.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:04:46] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, then let&#8217;s look at a single server and a single client.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:17] &lt;guido_g&gt;  jared___: any numbers?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:31] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Say the server is sending to the client. The client bounces, but while it&#8217;s down, the server has sent three messages. Do you need those three messages to be read by the client when it comes up?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:39] &lt;jared___&gt; But for your question, yes, I would expect the down servers to receive those messages.  But realistically in my case the connection would have been severed within 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:05] &lt;jared___&gt; Sorry, what I mean by that is that if the other end was truly disconnected, other mechanisms would have detected it, and this machine would then stop caring what messages made it through.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:15] &lt;jared___&gt; guido_g: what do you mean by numbers?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:33] &lt;guido_g&gt;  jared___: benchmarks for example</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:43] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, if you need to see messages &#8220;in the past&#8221; then you need a queue that&#8217;s going to keep track of who has pulled off what message. Basically, a &#8220;message broker&#8221;. These are in a lot of systems, and don&#8217;t have to be a separate process. If you look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spread.org/">http://www.spread.org/</a> you&#8217;ll see something that uses a messaging system that might be more what you&#8217;re looking for.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:08:56] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Spread has the delivery guarantee. It&#8217;s also open source.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:06] &lt;guido_g&gt;  whereas spread also is not a _traditional_ broker based queueing system</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:39] &lt;guido_g&gt;  but the process has to be member of the group when the message is sent, afair</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:50] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed. Totally. And there are limitations to Spread. Which is why I&#8217;m here with ZeroMQ, but it does have the guaranteed delivery.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:10:18] &lt;jared___&gt; Great, I&#8217;ll check that out right now.  Thanks for your help!  I&#8217;ll stick around here in case I have more 0MQ questions.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:34:37] &lt;jared___&gt; Bummer, the overhead of spread seems pretty high.  I am need _very_ good performance so the group management overhead is probably more than I am willing to pay.  I&#8217;ll keep probing around though.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:39:05] &lt;guido_g&gt;  performance and delivery gurantees are contradictory in most cases</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:43:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed... if you need guarantees, then you need persistence of some kind. That costs time. Regardless of anything else.

<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:52:46] &lt;guido_g&gt;  i can guarantee that there&#8217;re none</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:52:57] &lt;guido_g&gt;  pub/sub is like radio broadcast</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:56:44] &lt;jared___&gt; do any of the models provide a guarantee that once I hand the message to 0MQ that it will be delivered........eventually</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:56:48] &lt;jared___&gt; ?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:57:43] &lt;jared___&gt; I am determining whether or not an additional &#8216;message tracking&#8217; layer would need to be built on top of 0MQ, should I decide to use it.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:58:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I was under the impression that the pgm and epgm protocols were using reliable multicast from OpenPGM. If so, then you&#8217;re going to have receipt, but not guaranteed delivery. If the listener isn&#8217;t on when the message is sent, then it&#8217;s going ot miss it.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [09:59:39] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   If you need really &#8220;once-and-only-once&#8221; delivery, then you need to have a queue where it tracks persistent subscriptions and persistent publishers and that&#8217;s a lot more work.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:00:27] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   So, from the sounds of it, I&#8217;d say the answer to your question is &#8220;Yes, you need to write that message tracking layer.&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Then again, I&#8217;ve only been in this codebase for about 3 days now, but having been around the block a few times with other messaging systems, the pieces become very familiar.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:29] &lt;jared___&gt; What I really need is a layer that can guarantee that once the application hands it a message to this layer, destined for a given endpoint, that the other endpoint will see them in order, and eventually.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:01:55] &lt;jared___&gt; I figured this was a guarantee not provided, since its pretty specific, but just wanted to make sure.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:02:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, I&#8217;m going to ask a few &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; questions that will help me understand your requirements.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:03:03] &lt;jared___&gt; ok, sure.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:03:10] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Say you have a server and ten clients. When the server sends the first message, only five of those clients are up and listening. An hour later, the other five start up. When the second set start up, do they need to see that message that was sent an hour ago?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:04:26] &lt;jared___&gt; I am more interested in a pipe between two endpoints only, but the request-reply model seems like it has low performance.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:04:46] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, then let&#8217;s look at a single server and a single client.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:17] &lt;guido_g&gt;  jared___: any numbers?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:31] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Say the server is sending to the client. The client bounces, but while it&#8217;s down, the server has sent three messages. Do you need those three messages to be read by the client when it comes up?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:05:39] &lt;jared___&gt; But for your question, yes, I would expect the down servers to receive those messages.  But realistically in my case the connection would have been severed within 10 seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:05] &lt;jared___&gt; Sorry, what I mean by that is that if the other end was truly disconnected, other mechanisms would have detected it, and this machine would then stop caring what messages made it through.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:15] &lt;jared___&gt; guido_g: what do you mean by numbers?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:33] &lt;guido_g&gt;  jared___: benchmarks for example</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:07:43] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   OK, if you need to see messages &#8220;in the past&#8221; then you need a queue that&#8217;s going to keep track of who has pulled off what message. Basically, a &#8220;message broker&#8221;. These are in a lot of systems, and don&#8217;t have to be a separate process. If you look at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spread.org/">http://www.spread.org/</a> you&#8217;ll see something that uses a messaging system that might be more what you&#8217;re looking for.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:08:56] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Spread has the delivery guarantee. It&#8217;s also open source.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:06] &lt;guido_g&gt;  whereas spread also is not a _traditional_ broker based queueing system</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:39] &lt;guido_g&gt;  but the process has to be member of the group when the message is sent, afair</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:09:50] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed. Totally. And there are limitations to Spread. Which is why I&#8217;m here with ZeroMQ, but it does have the guaranteed delivery.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:10:18] &lt;jared___&gt; Great, I&#8217;ll check that out right now.  Thanks for your help!  I&#8217;ll stick around here in case I have more 0MQ questions.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:11:05] &lt;guido_g&gt;  there should be a book about brokerless messaging</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:12:07] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I&#8217;ve wished many times that there were more docs (books, sites, etc.) on this stuff. It&#8217;s hard to find all this stuff and see the pros and cons easily. I&#8217;ll ask Santa... he&#8217;s been good to me in the past.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:12:54] &lt;guido_g&gt;  great idea :)</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:34:37] &lt;jared___&gt; Bummer, the overhead of spread seems pretty high.  I am need _very_ good performance so the group management overhead is probably more than I am willing to pay.  I&#8217;ll keep probing around though.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:39:05] &lt;guido_g&gt;  performance and delivery gurantees are contradictory in most cases</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:43:37] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Agreed... if you need guarantees, then you need persistence of some kind. That costs time. Regardless of anything else. You&#8217;re not going to find a fast, reliable persistence. Memory is fast, but doesn&#8217;t survive reboots. Disk is reliable, but not fast. You have a fundamental issue, here. No easy solution. You&#8217;re going to have to make some kind of trade-off.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 23 July 2010] [10:44:47] &lt;guido_g&gt;  well phrased</div>
