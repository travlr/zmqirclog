There&#8217;s no utility of OpenPGM for me outside of ZeroMQ, and a large part of ZeroMQ (for me) is the epgm transport. So if you unbundle these, it&#8217;s going to make maintenance harder for me.

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [11:11:08] &lt;sustrik&gt;        well, yes, but that means you recovery interval is 125x shorter</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [15:18:36] &lt;neale1&gt; In my own case I discovered 0MQ when I was tasked with a project that needed to have several &#8220;collector&#8221; clients receive raw data, package it, and send it to a sink which would process the collected data. In addition I wanted to add collectors at will, ensure delivery, receive configuration information from the server. And do this in a minimal footprint with little affect on overall CPU on the systems where those collectors are ru</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [15:18:54] &lt;neale1&gt; Oh, and not require the customer install a full-fledged broker type system</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:00:03] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        good question, probably dependent on the issue list on github getting cleaned up a bit</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:02:18] &lt;d4de&gt;   ooh well ... thanks :-D</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:03:01] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        there are a couple of weird platform dependent / compiler optimisation issues with the PGM socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:03:26] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        and there has been issues with zmq_term</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:03:36] &lt;d4de&gt;   so it is just PGM that is putting it back ... I saw that you guys has already fixed some annoying bugs in 2.1 beta, so I keep wondering what is left</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:03:41] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        you can always ask Martin again on the list</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:04:29] &lt;d4de&gt;   hmm still no IPv6 support huh?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:04:58] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        well yes and no</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:05:44] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        there probably needs to be extra flags or specification for using IPv4 or IPv6, or both</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:05:58] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        similar to BSD&#8217;s IPV6ONLY</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:06:17] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        binding to eth0:* tends to be complicated in a multi-stack environment</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:07:39] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        surprisingly PGM has better support for IPv6 but it depends on reasonable OS support</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:08:11] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        there are some issues with the glibc in Ubuntu 10.10 there are definitely unexpected</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:08:24] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        for example ::1 resolves as 127.0.0.1</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:09:38] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        one easy path is to assume IPv4 only and follow SMTP&#8217;s requirement to use a IPv6: prefix</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 February 2011] [21:11:12] &lt;Steve-o&gt;        I have to concede I only follow the PGM parts of ZeroMQ, not so much the other parts</div>
