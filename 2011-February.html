<div class="line">[Friday 04 February 2011] [09:47:59] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;     I know I&#8217;m only a user, and this is your choice, but as for me, ZeroMQ &#8220;contains&#8221; OpenPGM. There&#8217;s no utility of OpenPGM for me outside of ZeroMQ, and a large part of ZeroMQ (for me) is the epgm transport. So if you unbundle these, it&#8217;s going to make maintenance harder for me. I&#8217;ll have to make sure that no machine in the organization has the &#8220;wrong&#8221; OpenPGM for ZeroMQ, etc.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 04 February 2011] [09:48:52] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;     I know it seems simple to unbundle them, and I can certainly see the advantages, but just one vote from your user base is that in an organization with many machines, this is something that I&#8217;d rather not have to deal with.</div>
