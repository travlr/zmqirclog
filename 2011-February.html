<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:44:24] &lt;pieterh&gt;        right but if you mix new wine with the old wine there is a problem</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:51:29] &lt;pieterh&gt;        let me add two things I think would help</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:51:50] &lt;pieterh&gt;        a. new code goes into HEAD asap, not topic branches unless extremely unstable</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:52:07] &lt;pieterh&gt;        b. latest dev is a branch and gets bug fixes from head</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:52:47] &lt;pieterh&gt;        rationale for a = faster testing of new code is very valuable</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:52:50] &lt;mikko&gt;  latest dev is bug fixes only?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:52:56] &lt;pieterh&gt;        hmm, yes</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:02] &lt;pieterh&gt;        at least</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;        then it&#8217;s same as maint</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:09] &lt;mikko&gt;  so when do new features get in?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:28] &lt;pieterh&gt;        well, this rolls around</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:31] &lt;mikko&gt;  and is new version branched of from HEAD?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:36] &lt;pieterh&gt;        latest dev becomes stable at a certain point</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:41] &lt;pieterh&gt;        and then new dev is branched from head</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:49] &lt;pieterh&gt;        like I&#8217;d suggest 2.1.0 + patches is today ready for stable</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:53:56] &lt;pieterh&gt;        we want people to move off 2.0.10</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:54:11] &lt;pieterh&gt;        of course the packages can remain available</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:54:24] &lt;pieterh&gt;        but we don&#8217;t want people asking about stuff that was fixed 6 months ago</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:54:56] &lt;sustrik&gt;        i still don&#8217;t see why we need two maintenance branches instead of a single one</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:55:10] &lt;pieterh&gt;        because you have two generations of &#8216;officially released&#8217; code</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:56:06] &lt;pieterh&gt;        i&#8217;m happy to do this</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:56:09] &lt;pieterh&gt;        i&#8217;ve said that often</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:56:33] &lt;mikko&gt;  if the process is being reviewed can we also look into using pull requests on github instead of signed patches?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:56:42] &lt;pieterh&gt;        mikko: +1</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:57:29] &lt;pieterh&gt;        it allows the author of a patch to request explicitly that it be applied to a set of target branches</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:57:34] &lt;pieterh&gt;        and it creates an asynchronous workflow</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:58:56] &lt;sustrik&gt;        ok, we can have as many maintenance branches as we want</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:59:14] &lt;sustrik&gt;        have a look at linux, there are some 4-5 of them</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:59:36] &lt;sustrik&gt;        as for new features, linux kernel uses concept of merge windows</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [08:59:56] &lt;sustrik&gt;        nope</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:00:04] &lt;sustrik&gt;        basically, there&#8217;s a week or two in each cycle</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:00:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;        when people can ask their new code to be merged</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:00:26] &lt;pieterh&gt;        linux kernel processes are <em>weird</em>, they don&#8217;t always make good examples</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:00:32] &lt;sustrik&gt;        the rest of the cycle is used to stabilise the new codebase</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:01:33] &lt;sustrik&gt;        the merge windows eases the stabilisation process</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:02:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;        it makes the development of new features to happen in discrete steps</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:02:18] &lt;pieterh&gt;        i&#8217;d really avoid trying to imitate the Linux processes unless they solve real problems we face</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:02:44] &lt;mikko&gt;  i think one of the issues to solve is: clear and visible roadmap for new features</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:02:49] &lt;sustrik&gt;        well, this is the problem we face:</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:03:23] &lt;sustrik&gt;        so what you have is a shifting landscape</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 February 2011] [09:04:07] &lt;pieterh&gt;        you cannot take a shifting landscape to stability</div>

I&#8217;m using libev and the receive side seems fine. But, for sending (receive 0MQ message then put it onto a TCP socket), it looks like I need to zmq_poll() when libev gives me EV_WRITE, is there a better way of doing this? A zmq ca</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 23 February 2011] [05:57:19] &lt;pieterh&gt;     the only resolution to that was to not touch each others&#8217; repos</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 23 February 2011] [05:57:35] &lt;pieterh&gt;     I&#8217;d have preferred one repo with X branches, one per release, that could be maintained</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 23 February 2011] [05:58:32] &lt;pieterh&gt;     hence the current solution</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [13:55:14] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   is this used</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:30:25] &lt;Guthur&gt;       apexi200sx, IOCP is not used currently on windows</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:30:52] &lt;Guthur&gt;       which is part of the reason there is no IPC on the win platform</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:32:07] &lt;Guthur&gt;       there has been some  preliminary research into bring IOCP to zmq which would allow the use of named pipes and so bring IPC</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:32:49] &lt;Guthur&gt;       part of the problem is that IOCP does not directly provide all the functionality of epoll like mechanisms</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:33:41] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   Guthur: I see, so, Windows is probably not the best choice of platform for zeromq at this time</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:33:43] &lt;Guthur&gt;       I hope to look into this problem more in the future, my workload does not allow for it at the moment though</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:34:29] &lt;Guthur&gt;       apexi200sx, IPC is a pretty large whole, that is true</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:34:50] &lt;Guthur&gt;       but it&#8217;s still reasonable in other regards</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:38:06] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   I could still have windows subscribers, but for large volume  forwarding &#8220;devices&#8221; with many connected devices its probably best to use a <a href="#id57"><span class="problematic" id="id58">*</span></a>nix type os</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:38:07] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   ?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:44:48] &lt;Guthur&gt;       if you want to have them communicating between processes (IPC) then yeah, inproc is still ok though</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:45:28] &lt;Guthur&gt;       so if those forwarding devices are all connecting to workers in the same process it is not a problem</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:46:03] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   Guthur: do you have much experience with Python</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:46:35] &lt;Guthur&gt;       limited experience unfortunately</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:46:48] &lt;mikko&gt;        good evening</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:49:30] &lt;Guthur&gt;       apexi200sx, I suppose the GIL would mean you want separate processes with python, correct?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:49:38] &lt;Guthur&gt;       or is it not really a factor</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [15:53:28] &lt;mikko&gt;        pieterh: there?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [16:05:58] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   Guthur: Yes, the GIL is an issue for CPU bound Python applications.  Only 1 thread at a time can be executing python code at any time.  A CPU bound python application actually runs slower if you try to split the work over 2 or more threads than a single thread</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [16:06:59] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   The GIL i released though when a thread akes an IO request, so having an IO thread and a processing thread is still useful</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [16:07:23] &lt;apexi200sx&gt;   so yeah processes are the way to go in Python</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:39:52] &lt;Evet&gt; Steve-o: what about freebsd?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:40:34] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      haven&#8217;t tested the last build but basically you&#8217;re at NIC saturation</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:41:13] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      e.g. if you can squeeze 110,000 out of Linux you can get say 105,000 out of FreeBSD</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:41:42] &lt;Evet&gt; why?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:41:44] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      might be better numbers from freebsd to freebsd though</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:44:10] &lt;Evet&gt; which linux distro youre testing?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:44:34] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      this is Ubuntu 10.10 with low-latency kernel</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:47:26] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      it&#8217;s not the fastest kernel but left over from testing the latency heat maps I generated before</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:48:55] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      performance would be better on dual core</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:50:28] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      going numa would work well too as I don&#8217;t implement any memory pools which can improve performance a bit</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 February 2011] [22:52:01] &lt;Steve-o&gt;      if I find the bug with ticket rw spinlocks the latency will improve a bit more</div>
