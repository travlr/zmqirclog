<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:33:07] &lt;mikko&gt; pythonirc1011: probably it&#8217;s just building the installer</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:48:53] &lt;pythonirc1011&gt; perhaps ship the library pre-compiler on windows</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:04] &lt;sustrik&gt;       exactly</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;       what you need is 2 libraties</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:18] &lt;sustrik&gt;       and libpyzmq</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:24] &lt;sustrik&gt;       you need to compile them</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:42] &lt;pythonirc1011&gt; k, that should be doable...are they dlls?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:49:59] &lt;sustrik&gt;       i am not sure whether python needs anythig else aside of those libs</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:50:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;       yes, i think so</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:50:48] &lt;pythonirc1011&gt; I&#8217;ll look into it soon. Thanks.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:55:38] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, does zma uses lock free ring buffers  ? sometalk i listened mentioned it being musch faster than using queues becose of contention</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:55:51] &lt;dos000&gt;        s/zma/0mq</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:56:04] &lt;sustrik&gt;       yes, the queues are lock-free</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:56:46] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, is it ringbuffer based ?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:57:06] &lt;sustrik&gt;       messages are allocated in blocks</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:57:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;       (256 per block)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:57:40] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, here is the talk <a class="reference external" href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/LMAX</a> jump to 36:00 for the real meat.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:57:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;       one block is recycled to eliminate excessive allocation/deallocation</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:58:17] &lt;dos000&gt;        its kinda java oriented but i think the same issues apply in c++</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:58:28] &lt;sustrik&gt;       however, if the number of messages in the queue drops, only 1 block is recycled, any subsequent blocvks are dealloc&#8217;d</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:58:41] &lt;dos000&gt;        ah!</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:59:02] &lt;dos000&gt;        thats seems smarter .. they allocate 2min off hand to counter java gc</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:59:09] &lt;dos000&gt;        2 millions</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:59:31] &lt;sustrik&gt;       well, depends on the use case</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [13:59:50] &lt;sustrik&gt;       it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not good to do on a sensor or an embedded system</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:00:11] &lt;sustrik&gt;       0mq tries to be generic</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:00:12] &lt;dos000&gt;        indeed .. for a server its much different</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:00:26] &lt;sustrik&gt;       you can of course tune it by hand if you want to</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:00:48] &lt;sustrik&gt;       see src/config.hpp</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:01:51] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, so its configurable by source changes only then</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:02:16] &lt;sustrik&gt;       there are 2 mechanisms there</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:02:26] &lt;sustrik&gt;       config.hpp are compile-time options</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:02:28] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, it will apply to all queues then</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:02:40] &lt;sustrik&gt;       socket options can be used in run-time</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:02:49] &lt;dos000&gt;        ah!</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:08] &lt;sustrik&gt;       it&#8217;s a matter to consider whether specific tuning parameter</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:09] &lt;dos000&gt;        socket options allow to you bigger/smaller buffers ?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:18] &lt;sustrik&gt;       should be a socket option or a compile-time param</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:36] &lt;sustrik&gt;       socket option allow to set the maximal buffer size</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:49] &lt;dos000&gt;        i cant use compile time options</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:03:58] &lt;sustrik&gt;       what are you trying to do?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:05:13] &lt;dos000&gt;        i am writing queues with different bechmarking options</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:05:24] &lt;dos000&gt;        so i want to see effect of the changes</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:06:36] &lt;sustrik&gt;       you mean you are implementing the queues yourself?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:06:41] &lt;dos000&gt;        so far i have 0mq and fastflow ( <a class="reference external" href="http://calvados.di.unipi.it/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ffnamespace:about">http://calvados.di.unipi.it/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ffnamespace:about</a> ) on my list</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:06:59] &lt;sustrik&gt;       ok, i see</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:07:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;       and what exactly are you missing?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:08:39] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, i only have one issue so far ...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:09:17] &lt;dos000&gt;        i have to receive the events and process them in  java ...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:10:07] &lt;dos000&gt;        i either reimplement the lockfree ring buffers in java .. or use jzmq</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:10:39] &lt;dos000&gt;        it looks deceptively easy to write it in java !</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:11:27] &lt;sustrik&gt;       i still don&#8217;t see what you are missing :)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:11:39] &lt;sustrik&gt;       0mq is lock-free</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:11:43] &lt;dos000&gt;        yes ... i am not missing anything ...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:11:48] &lt;dos000&gt;        i just have options !</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:12:04] &lt;sustrik&gt;       implementing the lock-free queeu is not hard</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:12:20] &lt;sustrik&gt;       it may become a problem as you want to add more features</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:12:23] &lt;dos000&gt;        sustrik, there is locking when you call c++ functions from java</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:12:28] &lt;sustrik&gt;       like limiting the number of messages in queue</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:12:31] &lt;sustrik&gt;       or somesuch</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:00] &lt;sustrik&gt;       is there, i am not familiar with how jzmq works atm</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:09] &lt;dos000&gt;        its inherent in jni</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;       i see</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:28] &lt;sustrik&gt;       then you have to reimplement it yourself</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:35] &lt;dos000&gt;        another option would be to receive the events via sockets in java</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:13:53] &lt;sustrik&gt;       what sockets?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:14:40] &lt;dos000&gt;        instead of passing the messages via jni pass it via a the (local) netwrk interface</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [14:15:00] &lt;dos000&gt;        of course that would be slower i imagine</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [15:33:17] &lt;andrewvc&gt;      So, here&#8217;s a nonblocking question</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [15:36:31] &lt;andrewvc&gt;      so, if I get an errno 95 doing a recv NOBLOCK</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 01 January 2011] [15:37:28] &lt;andrewvc&gt;      I was expecting an EAGAIN</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:28:01] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       consider PGM an administrative option rather than anything particular technical for development</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:28:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;       right, you can start with tcp and switch to pgm when needed</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:44:53] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       well it&#8217;s usually easiest if you have a target architecture to develop for,</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 11 January 2011] [19:44:12] &lt;zchrish&gt;        If I have a PUBSUB system with 3 subscribers that can handle data rates of 10,000 - 20,000 - 30,000 messages per second respectively, how many messages would arrive at the fastest subscriber after 10 seconds?

<div class="line">[Tuesday 11 January 2011] [20:10:19] &lt;zchrish&gt;        The result of the above test suggests that PUBSUB sets the transmisstion rate to the slowest subscriber; is that correct?

<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:35:22] &lt;mikko&gt;   what you need to do roughly is:</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:35:35] &lt;mikko&gt;   you create a zmq socket and connect/bind it</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:35:51] &lt;mikko&gt;   you call getsockopt ZMQ_FD on the socket to get a filehandle</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:39:48] &lt;mikko&gt;   so when gevent signals that socket is readable you need to read until you get EAGAIN</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 22 January 2011] [21:37:04] &lt;kan&gt;   hang on, i guess you have one socket and bind multiple URIs to the socket, then clients can subscribe to the URI they want to listen to?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 23 January 2011] [05:04:44] &lt;kanch&gt;   hey guys if I want to have multiple publishers and have clients only listen to some of the publishers mesages, do I have a socket per publisher?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 23 January 2011] [05:20:32] &lt;mikko&gt;   kanch: you would normally use topics maybe</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 23 January 2011] [06:07:06] &lt;mikko&gt;   it depends on what is likely to be the bottleneck</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 23 January 2011] [06:07:35] &lt;mikko&gt;   with the current filtering system (before subscription forwarding is in place) there is more network usage as the messages are sent to all subscribers</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 04 January 2011] [06:33:19] &lt;mikko&gt;  orestis: send/recv is async yes but there is a possiblity that the calls block</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 04 January 2011] [06:38:16] &lt;mikko&gt;  orestis: i guess that is true. then again as far as i understand twisted is more general purpose ae framework where as 0mq is messaging stack</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 04 January 2011] [06:41:02] &lt;orestis&gt;        yes, apparently. I mainly wanted to use 0mq to split a monolithic gui app that does heavy I/O into separate processes.

In the erlang bindings, this causes a problem, because it hard locks the erlang vm, not allowing the sockets to be cleaned up and closed (which would unblock the zmq_term call).  As such it turns into a dead lock.   Of course I can put smarts into the erlang driver to deal with this issue, but...</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:22:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;       in most cases tcp makes more sense</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:23:04] &lt;sustrik&gt;       it requires good hardware etc.</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:27:37] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       100mb is around $5,000 the closest I saw last check, slower speeds all the way down to $250 for DSL routers, etc.</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:28:01] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       consider PGM an administrative option rather than anything particular technical for development</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:28:46] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       that&#8217;s how zeromq has been developed, choose a ZMQ_PUB socket and run it to the ground with TCP until you really need scaling</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:28:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;       right, you can start with tcp and switch to pgm when needed</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:41:00] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       well there is plenty of scope with zeromq</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:41:58] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       a lot can be made on top, e.g. last value cache, certified delivery, transactional delivery, virtual circuits, http tunneling, encryption, authentication, proxying, etc</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:43:09] &lt;parik&gt; Great..Since I am novice and don&#8217;t know How I can also be felt great of doing/contributing something..Just I want to know How can I contribute...Need some guidance on this front</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 06 January 2011] [07:44:53] &lt;Steve-o&gt;       well it&#8217;s usually easiest if you have a target architecture to develop for,</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:35:22] &lt;mikko&gt;   what you need to do roughly is:</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:35:51] &lt;mikko&gt;   you call getsockopt ZMQ_FD on the socket to get a filehandle</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 17 January 2011] [19:39:48] &lt;mikko&gt;   so when gevent signals that socket is readable you need to read until you get EAGAIN</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 26 January 2011] [09:22:11] &lt;stockMQ&gt;      I am assuming that a lot of zeroMQ users would be using any of the above messaging</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 26 January 2011] [09:25:33] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I do NOT use protobufs, but do use the Google VarInt encoding to pack ints.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 26 January 2011] [09:26:05] &lt;stockMQ&gt;      so my understanding is once you receive the feed you might be processing it (aggregating maybe) and then publish</div>

<div class="line">[Wednesday 26 January 2011] [09:27:44] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   Actually, I decode the feed, make a message for each &#8216;tick&#8217;, and then serialize that message into a ZMQ message and send it. On the receiver, I get the payload, deserialize it into a message and use it.</div>
<div class="line">[Wednesday 26 January 2011] [09:28:11] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;   I also add in conflation, use multiple multicast channels to distribute the load, etc.</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:31:54] &lt;sustrik&gt; can you check out the error code?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:32:00] &lt;monokrome&gt;       We relieved the error from switching from a Poller to ZMQ_NOBLOCK</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:33:11] &lt;monokrome&gt;       There was no error code. It is an assertion checking that the size of a result wasn&#8217;t SOCKET_ERROR</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:33:21] &lt;monokrome&gt;       I can not reproduce this easily</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:33:53] &lt;monokrome&gt;       However, it happened with a simple client passing data as a protocol buffer with a string prefix to a server and the server passing it back. It occured during the client call to recv</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:34:18] &lt;monokrome&gt;       I was using PyZMQ, so it could have occured due to their code also.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:34:48] &lt;monokrome&gt;       I&#8217;m not sure how Poller works, so I change my coworkers code to use ZMQ_NOBLOCK and it was fixed.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:34:59] &lt;monokrome&gt;       The poller was also causing a very large drop in frames per second</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:35:22] &lt;sustrik&gt; what you can do is add printf() to tcp_socket.cpp</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:35:47] &lt;monokrome&gt;       Well, this was a while ago and ZMQ_NOBLOCK fixed the issue</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 31 January 2011] [04:36:07] &lt;monokrome&gt;       Albeit, I think poller might be more efficient</div>
