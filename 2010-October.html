<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:38:26] &lt;twittard&gt;        I just used the wrong lingo.  Networking is not my forte.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:38:54] &lt;Pe_Ell&gt;  you want to embed the 0mq socket into your application?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:39:19] &lt;twittard&gt;        Basically, pretend you went &#8220;TCPSocket.connect&#8221; and it magically opened a connection for you.  Then you call &#8221;.send&#8221; and send it some series of bytes that you cobbled together.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:39:44] &lt;twittard&gt;        Pe_Ell: well, yeah.  I&#8217;m currently bargaining with the notion that I might have to write my own networking code.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:40:30] &lt;Pe_Ell&gt;  you need your application traffic to be distributed?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:42:12] &lt;twittard&gt;        Pe_Ell: The later, more than the former.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:42:41] &lt;Pe_Ell&gt;  gonna guess no, but hopefully someone with more knowledge will answer.....  :)</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:43:52] &lt;twittard&gt;        my knowledge of 0mq is nil.  my education process generally starts with some stupid questions.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:44:05] &lt;guido_g&gt; MQ can&#8217;t talk to arbitrary endpoints, it needs to be a MQ aware endpoint due to the fact that there is &#8220;invisible&#8221; communication going on on the wire</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [00:44:12] &lt;Pe_Ell&gt;  fair enough, I do the same thing after I read a few webpages...  :)</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:16:57] &lt;rntz&gt;    Is there some way to wait for a socket to send all its queued messages to the network?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:17:18] &lt;rntz&gt;    analogous in some sense to fflush()</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:17:58] &lt;rntz&gt;    ... really? There&#8217;s no way to do that? That seems like a terrible oversight.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:19:57] &lt;guido_g&gt; mq is async in nature, so waiting was not built in</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:21:56] &lt;sustrik&gt; sure</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:22:08] &lt;guido_g&gt; flush on close, so to speak</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:22:35] &lt;guido_g&gt; not a practical way of flushing messages out</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:22:36] &lt;sustrik&gt; use the master branch from the git repo</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:31:15] &lt;Pe_Ell&gt;  you added more to page2 and expanded page3 recently</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:33:33] &lt;guido_g&gt; but no-one else complained so far, so wouldn&#8217;t take it too serious</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [01:34:06] &lt;sustrik&gt; well, if there&#8217;s a well-coined term instead of mama and papa</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 01 October 2010] [05:08:09] &lt;sustrik&gt; yeah, but i assume the problem is not having the hardware as such, but running it 24/7</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:11:31] &lt;mikko&gt;   this fixes the tests for me</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:17:38] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   hey guys, anyone have a minute to answer some questions about using zmq in a problem I&#8217;m working on involving 50+ nodes?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:23:12] &lt;mikko&gt;   RyanSchneider: sure</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:25:34] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   So here&#8217;s the problem:  I&#8217;m doing load testing on our game, and need to launch load testing apps across 50+ EC2 instances, with each instance hosting ~5 processes.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:26:06] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   I want the processes on each instance to talk to an aggregator on the instance, and have each of the 50 aggregators talk to a &#8216;master&#8217;.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:26:54] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   The master knows the name/password to use for each load tester process.  I want to hand out each account once at startup, and replace it if a process goes down.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:27:21] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   So I&#8217;m thinking the startup would go something like this:</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:27:54] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Aggregator launches, and sends 5 &#8216;Request an Account&#8217; messages to Master</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:28:17] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - For each reply, it spawns a LoadTester process configured with that account.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:29:10] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - The aggregator also acts as a Device of some sort between LoadTester and MAster so LoadTester can keep Master up to date with it&#8217;s status.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:30:00] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   The part I&#8217;m struggling with is how to determine that a LoadTester has &#8216;gone down&#8217; (e.g. crashed) and to reclaim that account for another Aggregator/LoadTester process to use.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:30:27] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Should I use some sort of &#8216;keep-alive&#8217;/timestamp messages?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:31:23] &lt;mikko&gt;   do you want to check for both Aggregator and LoadTester to go down?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:31:32] &lt;mikko&gt;   or are you relying on the Aggregator to stay up?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:32:39] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Hmm, good question.  While under development I&#8217;d expect Aggregator&#8217;s to occasionally crash, so I guess I want to handle that too. :)</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:33:16] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   But my main concern is that I have X LoadTesters running with Accounts A1...AX.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:34:44] &lt;mikko&gt;   hmm</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:35:15] &lt;mikko&gt;   i guess you need some sort of heartbeat in two places</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:35:33] &lt;mikko&gt;   from Master -&gt; heartbeat -&gt; Aggregator -&gt; heartbeat -&gt; LoadTester</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:36:28] &lt;mikko&gt;   currently there is no way to detect a socket disconnection in the code</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:36:39] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Yeah that&#8217;s about what I was thinking.  What socket types (e.g. REP/REQ) work best for heartbeats?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:37:13] &lt;mikko&gt;   probably yes</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:37:28] &lt;mikko&gt;   it _should_ be something as simple as &#8220;ping? pong!&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:38:22] &lt;mikko&gt;   why do you have loadtesters in separate processes from the aggregator?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:38:32] &lt;mikko&gt;   wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to manage a pool of threads?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:38:45] &lt;mikko&gt;   (depending on language of course)</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:39:18] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   The LoadTester is a stand-alone process built by someone else.  It&#8217;s basically a headless version of our game.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:39:59] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Basically I run one LoadTester for each core on the EC2 instance.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:40:09] &lt;mikko&gt;   ah</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:40:50] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   I can add code to LoadTester, but just want to add simple things like &#8216;Send a heartbeat with these stats&#8217; rather than add a bunch of Aggregator-ish logic.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:41:02] &lt;mikko&gt;   makes sense</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:41:08] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   But LoadTester is a C++ app, and I&#8217;d prefer to write the MasterAggregator using PyZMQ</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:41:20] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   er But -&gt; Plus</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:41:44] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   So I guess I can do it like this:</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:42:01] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Every X seconds, LoadTester sends status packet to Aggregator.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:42:36] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Aggregator assumes LoadTester hung if status packet isn&#8217;t received in Y seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:42:54] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Aggregator sends status packet to Master every A seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:43:14] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Master assumes Aggregator is hung if status packet isn&#8217;t received in B seconds.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:43:42] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   So now the next big issue is how do I send A1...AX accounts one to each LoadTester?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:44:08] &lt;mikko&gt;   just a sec</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:44:13] &lt;mikko&gt;   ill draw this down</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:44:27] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   cool, I just logged into creately to do the same :)</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:45:54] &lt;mikko&gt;   so initial thoughts</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:46:02] &lt;mikko&gt;   does master know about all aggregators?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:46:33] &lt;mikko&gt;   i think it would be better if Aggregators would know about master</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:46:39] &lt;mikko&gt;   and register themselves to the master</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:47:01] &lt;mikko&gt;   and if you got enough LoadTesters running already the Aggregator would be in &#8220;idle queue&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:48:02] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   yeah, I think that makes sense.  Master binds, Aggregators connected.  Likewise I think LoadTester&#8217;s would connect() to a zmq socket that the Aggregator bind()s.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:49:13] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   We can also assume that we can always start-over with a clean slate (that is, when we do a test, Master and all EC2 instances can be restarted)</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:50:09] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Doh I forgot I have a meeting in 10 minutes :</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:51:37] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   So I think the startup process is more or less like:</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:51:51] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Aggregator connect()s to Master.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:52:26] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Aggregator sends X &#8216;Request Username&#8217; packets, where X is number of LoadTesters it wants to spawn.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:53:03] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - Master replies to each request when an Username U1..UX is available.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:53:33] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   - On reply, Aggregator spawns LoadTester and assigns it Username Ux.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:53:56] &lt;mikko&gt;   When Master gives out a username it would also give an address where to report periodically</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:54:41] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Would that address be used by Aggregator or directly by LoadTester?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:54:55] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   I&#8217;m guessing Aggregator</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:55:00] &lt;mikko&gt;   i would say yes</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:55:40] &lt;mikko&gt;   let me think for a bit</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:56:35] &lt;mikko&gt;   master is not likely to go down?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:56:51] &lt;mikko&gt;   i guess thats handled on the aggregators by stopping the loadtesters</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:57:03] &lt;mikko&gt;   so the master could bind one port for status reports</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:57:10] &lt;RyanSchneider&gt;   Correct.  If Master goes down, then I&#8217;d say its safe to assume the entire test cancelled.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 04 October 2010] [15:57:24] &lt;mikko&gt;   aggregator reports two things: that it&#8217;s up and which loadtesters are active and sending</div>

The issue is that x86 etc. use rdtsc to get the timer. For system z I have the option of using gettimeofday (CONFIG_HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY) or adding the equivalent of rdtsc (trivial). However, Makefile.in in the root of zeromq2 has an explicit -DCONFIG_HAVE_TSC. Could it use a test instead in configure.in to establish whether there is a TSC or that gettimeofday() is available?</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:49:44] &lt;iFire&gt; pieterh I guess I wanted to know about that authenticated pubsub thing</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:50:03] &lt;pieterh&gt;       well, i made a small prototype</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:50:24] &lt;pieterh&gt;       there are two ways, currently, with 0MQ</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:50:58] &lt;pieterh&gt;       1. use pubsub sockets but encrypt messages, and do key exchange on a secure channel after authentication</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:51:21] &lt;pieterh&gt;       2. use xrep sockets and explicitly route messages to authenticated subscribers</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:51:36] &lt;pieterh&gt;       i tested design 2, and it&#8217;s fairly straight-forward</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:52:06] &lt;iFire&gt; don&#8217;t you have to do authentication and encryption with #1 ?</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:52:16] &lt;iFire&gt; of each message</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:52:21] &lt;pieterh&gt;       yes, that&#8217;s what I meant to say</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:52:53] &lt;pieterh&gt;       with 2 you don&#8217;t need encryption unless you actually want to</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:53:41] &lt;pieterh&gt;       in short, with pub/sub sockets the security models are (a) open access and (b) encryption of each message</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:04] &lt;iFire&gt; well isn&#8217;t there a bandwith problem with #1 ?</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:10] &lt;pieterh&gt;       not really</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:14] &lt;pieterh&gt;       a CPU cost, for sure</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:21] &lt;pieterh&gt;       and key exchange is far from simple</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:28] &lt;iFire&gt; I mean don&#8217;t you get all the messages from #1</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:54:45] &lt;iFire&gt; ideally you want to be able to do both</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:55:06] &lt;pieterh&gt;       yes, pubsub would send all messages to all subscribers</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:56:22] &lt;iFire&gt; so I guess #2 should be the first thing done, then you can layer #1 onto it</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:56:39] &lt;pieterh&gt;       they are different approaches</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:56:54] &lt;pieterh&gt;       but you could layer key exchange and encryption on #2, yes</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:57:23] &lt;pieterh&gt;       #2 is not real pubsub any more, so no prefix matching etc.</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:57:30] &lt;pieterh&gt;       you could however do that at the publisher side</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:57:39] &lt;pieterh&gt;       in your own code</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:58:03] &lt;pieterh&gt;       so the design is you open two sockets to the server, a REQ and an XREQ</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:58:18] &lt;pieterh&gt;       you set the same identity on both sockets, before connecting</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:58:30] &lt;pieterh&gt;       you authenticate on the REQ</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:58:37] &lt;pieterh&gt;       the server uses two XREP sockets</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:58:58] &lt;pieterh&gt;       it knows your identity when you authenticate and it adds this to a list of authenticated subscribers</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:59:09] &lt;pieterh&gt;       then on the second socket it sends updates to all authenticated subscribers</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:59:33] &lt;pieterh&gt;       finally the subscribers need to heartbeat the server every so often, on that second XREP</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [04:59:42] &lt;pieterh&gt;       otherwise they are considered dead and taken off the list</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:00:27] &lt;pieterh&gt;       you can use this design to do custom pubsub routing too</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:00:39] &lt;pieterh&gt;       i guess i&#8217;ll cover this in Ch4</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:01:58] &lt;iFire&gt; pieterh we can&#8217;t change pubsub to send messages to everyone? and add a authentication envelope that is user defined</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:02:28] &lt;pieterh&gt;       it&#8217;s not that simple unfortunately</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:03:06] &lt;pieterh&gt;       doing an efficient pubsub is a complex problem</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:03:25] &lt;pieterh&gt;       there is work in progress to upstream subscriptions, i.e. do the routing at the pub side</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:04:03] &lt;pieterh&gt;       adding authentication to the socket layer would make it significantly more complex</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 07 October 2010] [05:04:39] &lt;pieterh&gt;       there is an option, perhaps to use TLS as a transport and then do authentication via certificates</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:21:01] &lt;Guthur&gt;  petrilli, The Common Lisp bindings are good if you fancy using CL instead of clojure</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:21:21] &lt;Guthur&gt;  The java bindings are not very mature though</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:21:34] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Not really.  Yeah, and they seem to combine a lot of ugly things, like JNI :)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:22:11] &lt;petrilli&gt;        I&#8217;m reminded why I left java years ago.  Alas, CL isn&#8217;t an acceptable tech for this project</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:22:12] &lt;Guthur&gt;  There is a CL implementation that targets the JVM if you are interested</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:22:14] &lt;Guthur&gt;  ABCL</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:22:23] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Wouldn&#8217;t that suffer from the same issues? :)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:23:08] &lt;Guthur&gt;  Depends if you see it as an issue, they are language bindings so generally its going to be foreign function calls</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:23:34] &lt;petrilli&gt;        I mean, it ends up using JNI to talk to the underlying libraries, correct?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:23:54] &lt;Guthur&gt;  ABCL could in theory use the CL binding</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:24:08] &lt;Guthur&gt;  there is one minor issue though</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:24:40] &lt;Guthur&gt;  one minor dependency of the CL binding is not supported in ABCL yet</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:26:21] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Not sure.  Alas, as far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no effort to implement the ZeroMQ bindings as pure Java, which means that deployment is always going to be VERY brittle.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:27:10] &lt;Guthur&gt;  I&#8217;m not surprised, as far as I am aware ZMQ is meant to be language neutral</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:27:26] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Right, but unfortunately, I&#8217;ve yet to find any JNI-based solution that isn&#8217;t horribly brittle.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:27:39] &lt;petrilli&gt;        language neutral doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;one implementation&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:27:56] &lt;Guthur&gt;  petrilli, Possibly, the current bindings need a lot of work</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:28:11] &lt;petrilli&gt;        That&#8217;s an understatement :(</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:28:45] &lt;Guthur&gt;  maybe start implementing it in Java, hehe</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:29:31] &lt;Guthur&gt;  I think the lack of motivation in the Java camp maybe because a prejudice towards using Java EE</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:29:57] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Could be. I have no interest in Java itself. Just it&#8217;s easier to &#8220;sell&#8221; solutions to clients if they run on the JVM</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:30:30] &lt;petrilli&gt;        Java holds as much interest and excitement as Ada ;)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:30:44] &lt;Guthur&gt;  hehe, yep i&#8217;d agree there</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:32:26] &lt;Guthur&gt;  But it will at least be a multi-acronym compliant solution</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 10 October 2010] [16:36:41] &lt;Guthur&gt;  CL would definitely be my tool of choice for programming,</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:46:53] &lt;guido_g&gt; NO</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:47:11] &lt;guido_g&gt; it depends on how many send calls have put something into the queues, no?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:47:16] &lt;sustrik&gt; no</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:47:21] &lt;guido_g&gt; tcp is no mq</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:47:52] &lt;sustrik&gt; what happens is that 0mq is either able to push the message to TCP buffer</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:48:13] &lt;guido_g&gt; then it&#8217;s remove from the send q, right?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:48:20] &lt;sustrik&gt; before TCP realises the other endpoint is not available</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:48:38] &lt;sustrik&gt; or the order of events is reverse</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:48:55] &lt;sustrik&gt; i.e. TCP realises the peer is not available first</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:48:58] &lt;guido_g&gt; see, you&#8217;re thinking way to deep here</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:49:03] &lt;sustrik&gt; then the message stays in 0mq buffer</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:49:16] &lt;sustrik&gt; so the figure is either 0 or 1</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:49:21] &lt;sustrik&gt; depending on tcp details</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:49:40] &lt;guido_g&gt; it just about getting some numbers, that might help to spot or trace problems and perfrmance</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:50:08] &lt;sustrik&gt; so let&#8217;s define them in a consistent way</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:50:30] &lt;sustrik&gt; rather then depending on details of underlying network transport</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:50:51] &lt;sustrik&gt; that way you are generic, consistent and future-proof</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:50:51] &lt;guido_g&gt; as i said, number of messages in a queue is a very nice and probably useful number</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:51:29] &lt;sustrik&gt; it&#8217;s a definition based on implementation details</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:51:54] &lt;sustrik&gt; real definition should be based on observable behaviour</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:52:24] &lt;guido_g&gt; because you provide an &#8220;abstration&#8221;</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [07:52:53] &lt;sustrik&gt; abstraction works only if you abstract from implementation details</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 11 October 2010] [08:04:09] &lt;guido_g&gt; i mean, there must be a point where mq treats a message as delivered (in the sense that the lower level has taken responsibility)</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:45:30] &lt;cremes&gt;        the docs are pretty clear on this</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:45:42] &lt;cremes&gt;        i&#8217;ll quote a small piece:</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:46:21] &lt;delaney&gt;       right... but how do you set an individual high water mark?</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:46:51] &lt;delaney&gt;       that was my initial question :P</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:47:25] &lt;delaney&gt;       if its global how do you have an individual one too?</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:48:25] &lt;delaney&gt;       the confusing part is it says in that sentence there is an individual HWM but then you just said there is only a global one</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:48:43] &lt;cremes&gt;        each socket has its own HWM</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:51:46] &lt;cremes&gt;        maybe this will help... let&#8217;s say you have 3 xreq sockets connecting to your xrep</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:52:04] &lt;cremes&gt;        2 of them are very fast while 1 is very slow, so it queues messages for the slow one</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:52:35] &lt;cremes&gt;        the fast sockets will continue to get messages</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:52:48] &lt;cremes&gt;        so internally there is probably a separate message queue for each connected socket</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:53:11] &lt;cremes&gt;        the HWM is enforced separately for each connected socket</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:53:20] &lt;cremes&gt;        that behavior is pretty specific to xrep sockets</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:55:40] &lt;deri&gt;  i thought the point of the hwm was just to get the average right so that chances are there will be enough overall headroom to keep things going. anyway, delaney do you think that a kernel parameter, assuming you are using the linux kernel, like inet_peer_maxttl could help here? maybe you can the offending connections can be clipped away so zeromq can notice it and free individual buffers</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 14 October 2010] [16:56:12] &lt;delaney&gt;       the wording is confusing... its not HWM per socket... its HWM per connection to a socket (since a socket have multiple connections)</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 15 October 2010] [14:07:46] &lt;cremes&gt;  e.g. pub/sub, req/rep, etc?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 15 October 2010] [14:09:04] &lt;aat&gt;     not that i can see; it aligns very closely with a traditional socket pattern of accepting, starting a new handler for that connection that holds state for the duration and tears down when the client disconnects</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 15 October 2010] [14:09:25] &lt;aat&gt;     which i can&#8217;t match to any of the zmq socket types</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 19 October 2010] [15:42:03] &lt;drbobbeaty&gt;     Essentially, the gist test receiver is listening to a part of what the transmitter is sending. But it&#8217;s also listening to a lot of &#8220;dead channels&#8221;.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:31:50] &lt;pieterh&gt; TheEffigy, another technique you can use, depending on the scenario, is dynamic port numbers</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:32:11] &lt;pieterh&gt; e.g. server can find an available port by scanning (trying to bind from 4096 up until it works)</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:35:10] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       yes perhaps</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:35:12] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       i&#8217;ll explain</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:36:09] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       my understanding is that the pub/sub matching is based on the client side only</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:37:50] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       however they might not be interested in all the data, which can be easily categorised on a few levels</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:39:45] &lt;pieterh&gt; Ok, kind of a classic scenario</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:39:53] &lt;pieterh&gt; so there are several options here</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:40:01] &lt;pieterh&gt; a. wait until 0MQ does publisher-side filtering</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:40:23] &lt;pieterh&gt; b. split data up over a set of static sockets</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:40:33] &lt;pieterh&gt; c. create and manage one socket per subscriber</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:40:53] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       c. is the approach i was going for</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:41:02] &lt;pieterh&gt; first question would be, how many subscribers?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:41:39] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       no more than 50</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:41:47] &lt;pieterh&gt; aight, so solution c would work</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:41:55] &lt;pieterh&gt; i would do it as follows</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:42:03] &lt;pieterh&gt; - req/rep socket for subscription requests</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:42:15] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       yep - done that part already</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:42:19] &lt;pieterh&gt; - one pub socket per subscriber</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:43:01] &lt;pieterh&gt; - some kind of heartbeating to allow server to clean up</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:43:15] &lt;pieterh&gt; - dynamic port selection using technique I already outlined</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:43:34] &lt;pieterh&gt; - i.e. server looks for available port within some range, then tells the client this endpoint</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:44:06] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       only question i have is basically what is the difference between using a pub socket instead of a pair?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:44:28] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       ah</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [08:44:45] &lt;TheEffigy&gt;       yeah, well that&#8217;s enough to make it a deal breaker</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [12:18:41] &lt;ptrb&gt;    is zmq_socket threadsafe on the context?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [12:23:54] &lt;pieterh&gt; in 0MQ/2.0.x you cannot use a socket except in the thread you created it in</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 22 October 2010] [12:27:18] &lt;ptrb&gt;    right, that&#8217;s clear. I mean if I create a shared context, can multiple threads call zmq_socket(ctx, ...); on it without protection</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 23 October 2010] [01:03:03] &lt;oscar&gt; hi all, I have a simple question, but can&#8217;t find the answer from the offical website. Is zeromq a super-socket? can it be used as a message queue?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 23 October 2010] [01:09:04] &lt;driethr&gt;       it is like a super-socket or a meta socket construct, but also you have to think about how you assemble the various pieces based on what you want to do.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 23 October 2010] [01:12:20] &lt;oscar&gt; thanks. so, you mean that I need to implement message queue base on 0mq, right?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 23 October 2010] [01:13:29] &lt;driethr&gt;       actually I have only played with the zmq_forwarder utility which is used to publish and subscribe to messages. it comes with a zmq_queue binary so maybe that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be using?</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 23 October 2010] [01:28:35] &lt;driethr&gt;       the queue is kind of like a forwarder that just listens to requests and then just sits there until it gets a corresponding response. so you would potentially have many requests just pending completion, and thus in-queue, individually, until they get their response.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 26 October 2010] [12:34:36] &lt;ntelford&gt;       and one of the most important aspects of that is having the ability to dynamically control stage resource allocation based on performance metrics, like the size of the stage queue</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 26 October 2010] [12:34:51] &lt;ntelford&gt;       it may well be that 0mq just isn&#8217;t a good fit for this</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 26 October 2010] [12:36:25] &lt;mikko&gt;  i still reckon that &#8216;messages-in-0mq send queue&#8217; would be a useful metric :)</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:34:35] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   oh wait</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:34:45] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   now :-)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:04] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   and it prints this:</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:06] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   3</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:06] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   4</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:06] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   &#8216;foo&#8217;</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:30] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   when I change the size in the setsockopt call to 4, it prints:</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:34] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   4</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:34] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   3</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:34] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   &#8216;foo&#8217;</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:35:51] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   not sure what to make from that</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:41:02] &lt;Guthur&gt;  Its possible that the strlen result is no actually very meaningful, as it is looking for a null terminated string which id isn&#8217;t</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:41:03] &lt;Guthur&gt;  no/not</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:41:48] &lt;Guthur&gt;  and so the result is fine in my eyes</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:43:12] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   good</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:43:20] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   I guess my FFI is confused by that</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:43:36] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   i.e. it is also looking for a zero</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:46:07] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   ah, no, that can&#8217;t be it</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:47:33] &lt;sustrik&gt; DerGuteMoritz: you are storing the result into the pointer to the string</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:47:41] &lt;sustrik&gt; instead of the buffer itself</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:48:09] &lt;sustrik&gt; zmq_getsockopt(socket, ZMQ_IDENTITY, &amp;id, &amp;id_size);</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:48:13] &lt;sustrik&gt; should be:</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:48:23] &lt;sustrik&gt; zmq_getsockopt(socket, ZMQ_IDENTITY, id, &amp;id_size);</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:48:50] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   sustrik: hmmm</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:48:58] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   so the example in <a class="reference external" href="http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_getsockopt.html">http://api.zeromq.org/zmq_getsockopt.html</a> is also wrong?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:20] &lt;sustrik&gt; that one is ok</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:25] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   because it is an int?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:29] &lt;sustrik&gt; yes</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:32] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   I see</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:34] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   :-)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:39] &lt;sustrik&gt; the parameter is pointer to integer</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:40]    * DerGuteMoritz tries</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:48] &lt;sustrik&gt; the string is pointer by itself</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:49:55] &lt;sustrik&gt; so you don&#8217;t have to &amp; it</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:34] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   I then get:</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:35] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   opt.c: In function main:</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:35] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   opt.c:13:5: warning: passing argument 3 of zmq_getsockopt discards qualifiers from pointer target type</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:38] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   /usr/include/zmq.h:206:16: note: expected void * but argument is of type const unsigned char *</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:47] &lt;sustrik&gt; it should be size_t</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:50:48] &lt;sustrik&gt; not int</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:51:18] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   oh, indeed</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:51:23] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   my bad</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:51:54] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   still the same warning though, of course</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:09] &lt;sustrik&gt; cast it to void* explicitly</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:14] &lt;sustrik&gt; to get rid of it</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:27] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   ah that works</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:33] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   ugh :-)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:44] &lt;sustrik&gt; :)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:52:58]    * DerGuteMoritz is happy to code in higher level languages mostly</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:53:24] &lt;sustrik&gt; you miss this kind of fun then :)</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [17:53:39] &lt;DerGuteMoritz&gt;   right :-D</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [18:20:32] &lt;Guthur&gt;  sustrik, I got a queue device working ok for clrzmq</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [18:21:18] &lt;Guthur&gt;  I basically done the multithreading demo from the guide</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [18:22:03] &lt;Guthur&gt;  only minor issue is that to do it the the device creation method requires the IntPtr from the socket objects</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [18:23:05] &lt;Guthur&gt;  which meant providing a getPtr method, which muddies the object interface slightly</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [18:24:36] &lt;Guthur&gt;  I&#8217;ll fork your github and push the changes there so you can have a look, might take awhile though as I don&#8217;t have git on my windows VM.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:23:50] &lt;Guthur&gt;  is the clrzmq essentially windows only?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:37:53] &lt;sustrik&gt; Guthur: it can be buillt with Mono as well</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:39:21] &lt;sustrik&gt; Why the need for IntPtr? can&#8217;t you pass the socket object itself as an argument?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:48:39] &lt;Guthur&gt;  sustrik, the underlying C function requires the pointer</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:48:56] &lt;Guthur&gt;  The user of clr will of course only have to pass the socket object</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:49:40] &lt;Guthur&gt;  maybe there is a cleaner way of getting the ptr than the accessor I added</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:49:57] &lt;Guthur&gt;  the code is up on my github</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [19:50:52] &lt;Guthur&gt;  when using mono is there some way of using the zmq .so file built on the linux?</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [20:06:51] &lt;Guthur&gt;  sustrik, I&#8217;m off to bed now, but if you get a chance to review that clrzmq code and suggestion any changes it would be great, its not a massive update to be fair, I&#8217;ll probably provide the multithreading demo when the device code is finalised</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 31 October 2010] [21:06:38] &lt;gandhijee&gt;       Hi all, what flag to i need to pass gcc for it to link/use zeromq?</div>
