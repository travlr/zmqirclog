<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [04:03:18] &lt;sustrik&gt; my point was that &#8220;localhost&#8221; is just a name a should thus be resolved by OS</div>

It certainly is an odd error message however &#8220;invalid arguement&#8221;, now that I&#8217;ve played with it &#8220;invalid argument&#8221; is the error message for any bogus hostname.

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [04:18:52] &lt;jugg&gt;    all of this mucking around is because I got off track while trying to debug odd observed behavior with zmq resulting from the socket type and transport combination.  eg pub/sub works fine with tcp:, but often fails with ipc:</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [04:38:40] &lt;jugg&gt;    well, it could still yet be very much user error, but it appeared that subscriptions were not taking affect, and in several instances, I would get an error about the ipc: address having some problem (the exact error messages are out of my scrollback).  Yet, those error message seemed to go away if I changed the socket type.  And when using tcp: I&#8217;ve never seen either of those issues.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [04:49:00] &lt;sustrik&gt; ok, i see</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [05:39:19] &lt;jugg&gt;    hmm, I thought publications got into the bit bucket if the endpont doesn&#8217;t exist.  This is the case if the publisher is the one that binds the socket, but if it is the subscriber that binds the socket, then the publisher queues up all of its messages.  Is this expected?  And if so, why the change in behavior depending on which socket type binds/connects?</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 June 2010] [07:48:16] &lt;sustrik&gt; when you bind, there&#8217;s no queue created at that moment</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 05 June 2010] [12:59:38] &lt;versificateur&gt;  it should be able to send another REQ without leavaing an exception</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 05 June 2010] [13:11:54] &lt;versificateur&gt;  now if you do a request you have to wait for an reply before sending another request (in REP/REQ pattern)</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:18:36] &lt;zedas&gt;    make the change and then wait until all the maintainers catch up</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:19:20] &lt;zedas&gt;    i mean you must have made this change last week right before release because i was trakcing your git and the pyzmq git</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:20:05] &lt;zedas&gt;    instead, 2.0.7 should have had the old api, and then 2.0.8 could have the new one.</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:23:38] &lt;zedas&gt;    next, if you want to change the API, then you make the decision to boost the 2nd number and people know it.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:23:55] &lt;zedas&gt;    then, right before you make the API change, release a final point release with the old api, and start on the new one.</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:24:23] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so you propose maintaining 2 codebases, old compatibility one and a development one?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:18:46] &lt;soren&gt;    Ok, another question...</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:19:30] &lt;soren&gt;    I currently have an app that uses amqp to send messages around using a topic exchange. All nodes connect to the same broker and pass msgs around.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:04] &lt;soren&gt;    To achieve something similar with zeromq, I should use multicast, right?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:30] &lt;sustrik&gt;  multicast is quite hard to configure</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:49] &lt;soren&gt;    Yeah, that&#8217;s the impression I get.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;  if you don&#8217;t care about having a single process in the middle</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:21:04] &lt;soren&gt;    Well, I do that now, but I&#8217;d like to not have to have that.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:21:40] &lt;sustrik&gt;  other option is to connect each subscriber to every publisher</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:02] &lt;soren&gt;    Yeah, that would suck.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  then multicast</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:15] &lt;soren&gt;    I&#8217;d like to be able to add and remove both publishers and subscribers on the fly.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:45] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the point is that for all-to-all communication you need a central node</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:23:29] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so these are the only options:</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:23:36] &lt;sustrik&gt;  1. connect each-to-each by hand</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:23:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;  2. have zmq_forwarder in the middle</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:24:21] &lt;soren&gt;    Ok. I&#8217;m trying the multicast example from the cookbook..</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:37:05] &lt;sustrik&gt;  depends on how your routers are set</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:48:20] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the consequence, for example, is that wireshark can parse pgm but not epgm</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:50:21] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the whole point is that PGM is defined to be stacked on top of IP directly</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:50:28] &lt;sustrik&gt;    same way as TCP or UDP is</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:50:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;    so the user-space implementation has to use raw IP sockets to implement it</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:51:27] &lt;sustrik&gt;    so what happens is that you start the publisher</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:51:32] &lt;sustrik&gt;    and sleep for 15 secs</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:51:53] &lt;sustrik&gt;    during those 15 secs, publisher is sending SPMs once in a while</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:52:07] &lt;sustrik&gt;    then you send a message</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:52:25] &lt;sustrik&gt;    but before it gets to the wire you shut down the publisher</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:52:43] &lt;sustrik&gt;    that&#8217;s it</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:54:01] &lt;umesh&gt;  also this 15s is not predictable time</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:54:30] &lt;umesh&gt;  so what can be the ideal solution to avoid 15 s or sleep</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:54:30] &lt;sustrik&gt;    sleep (15);</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:54:49] &lt;sustrik&gt;    drop the 15 sec sleep, it&#8217;s not needed</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:55:03] &lt;sustrik&gt;    what you need to do is to sleep _after_ you send the message</div>
<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:55:14] &lt;sustrik&gt;    so the publisher has some time to push the message to the wire</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 June 2010] [07:55:22] &lt;umesh&gt;  ok</div>

I wanted to get Twisted support for 0MQ a while ago but that kind of fizzled out due to a combination of health problems and technical issues nobody agreed on. I&#8217;m going to try again because I think 0MQ support in Twisted would be good for both 0MQ and Twisted (duh). What I think was the critical point of failure was that the interested ZMQ folks didn&#8217;t really understand Twisted&#8217;s gory guts and vice versa (Twisted people not</div>

Is there someone who could do a quick (less than 5m) review of the email I&#8217;m going to send to the TWisted mailing list to figure out if there are any grave technical mistakes in my understanding of ZMQ?</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:23:38] &lt;zedas&gt;    next, if you want to change the API, then you make the decision to boost the 2nd number and people know it.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:23:55] &lt;zedas&gt;    then, right before you make the API change, release a final point release with the old api, and start on the new one.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:24:18] &lt;zedas&gt;    that way, i can get the important bug fixes and changes just before the API change, and I can keep working while you can advance the API.</div>
<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:24:23] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so you propose maintaining 2 codebases, old compatibility one and a development one?</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:25:33] &lt;zedas&gt;    if someone needs to then they will, but with git backports are way easier</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:26:29] &lt;sustrik&gt;  so far we&#8217;ve tried to avoid insane version like 27.0.0</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:18:46] &lt;soren&gt;    Ok, another question...</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:19:30] &lt;soren&gt;    I currently have an app that uses amqp to send messages around using a topic exchange. All nodes connect to the same broker and pass msgs around.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:04] &lt;soren&gt;    To achieve something similar with zeromq, I should use multicast, right?</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:49] &lt;soren&gt;    Yeah, that&#8217;s the impression I get.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:20:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;  if you don&#8217;t care about having a single process in the middle</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:21:04] &lt;soren&gt;    Well, I do that now, but I&#8217;d like to not have to have that.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:02] &lt;soren&gt;    Yeah, that would suck.</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  then multicast</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:22:45] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the point is that for all-to-all communication you need a central node</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 22 June 2010] [15:51:44] &lt;soren&gt;   They all &#8220;connect&#8221; (is that even the correct term for multicast) to some multicast IP and port.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 22 June 2010] [15:51:59] &lt;soren&gt;   The publishers have no idea how many subscribers there are, right?</div>

I&#8217;m going to try again because I think 0MQ support in Twisted would be good for both 0MQ and Twisted (duh).

<div class="line">[Saturday 05 June 2010] [13:11:54] &lt;versificateur&gt;  now if you do a request you have to wait for an reply before sending another request (in REP/REQ pattern)</div>

<div class="line">[Sunday 06 June 2010] [17:23:38] &lt;zedas&gt;    next, if you want to change the API, then you make the decision to boost the 2nd number and people know it.</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 June 2010] [17:19:30] &lt;soren&gt;    I currently have an app that uses amqp to send messages around using a topic exchange. All nodes connect to the same broker and pass msgs around.</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:23:50] &lt;sustrik&gt;    at the moment zmq_poll translates to standard poll</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:24:20] &lt;sustrik&gt;    calling epoll makes not sense unless 0mq&#8217;s zmq_poll API changes in the corresponding way</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:06] &lt;zedas&gt;  sustrik: i was looking at the poll.cpp and others.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:20] &lt;zedas&gt;  so i was under the impression that zmq_poll abstracts poll/epoll/kqueue.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:25] &lt;zedas&gt;  at least that&#8217;s how the docs read.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:28] &lt;zedas&gt;  that not true?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:41] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the polling is done at 2 places</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:35:56] &lt;sustrik&gt;    I/O threads from the thread pool are polling using epoll/whatever</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:36:14] &lt;sustrik&gt;    meaning that if one 0MQ socket manages 100,000 TCP connections</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:36:30] &lt;sustrik&gt;    these are looked for by epoll-based mechanism (on Linux at least)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:36:41] &lt;sustrik&gt;    then there&#8217;s user polling (zmq_poll)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:36:56] &lt;sustrik&gt;    this at the moment translates to POSIX poll</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:37:13] &lt;sustrik&gt;    however, i wouldn&#8217;t expect anyone to use large amount of 0mq sockets</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:37:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the only problem is if user wants to poll on couple of 0mq sockets + large amount of system sockets</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:37:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;    is that your case?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:39:42] &lt;zedas&gt;  probably.  it&#8217;s in mongrel2</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:39:59] &lt;zedas&gt;  it craps out at 1024 sockets, which i haven&#8217;t investigated yet, but even poll should handle that</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:40:27] &lt;zedas&gt;  so, if you have these abstractions on epoll, kqueue, devpoll, and poll, why not have zmq_poll use them?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:40:46] &lt;sustrik&gt;    epoll reuires different API</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:40:51] &lt;sustrik&gt;    otherwise it&#8217;s of no use</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:41:21] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the performance boost is related to registering the fds separately from polling as such</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:42:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;    current zmq_poll is only a dumb copy of POSIX poll</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:42:47] &lt;sustrik&gt;    there have been some discussion on alternate API but it never got into implementation phase</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:43:52] &lt;zedas&gt;  well, plenty of libraries have given a consistent api to all the different event mechanisms</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:44:03] &lt;zedas&gt;  it&#8217;s not like this is anything new, even if they have different apis.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:44:27] &lt;zedas&gt;  looking at the code, it looks like you have the basis for the abstraction, probably just needs to be pulled into zmq_poll and used</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:44:33] &lt;zedas&gt;  i may look at doing that in the near future.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:44:50] &lt;sustrik&gt;    that would be nice</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:44:58] &lt;zedas&gt;  that and get rid of this #ifdef, the loop that seems to no be needed, etc.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:45:15] &lt;sustrik&gt;    what loop?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:46:11] &lt;zedas&gt;  the double nested while(true)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:46:26] &lt;zedas&gt;  haven&#8217;t seen a poll loop implemented that way, so i&#8217;m assuming there&#8217;s something odd there</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:47:41] &lt;zedas&gt;  yeah i think i could clean this up and make it use the abstractions you&#8217;ve got</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:47:57] &lt;zedas&gt;  or at least make it use epoll if that&#8217;s available.</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:48:25] &lt;zedas&gt;  hehe hell i could just write a zmq_epoll and zmq_kqueue and leave it to the developer :-)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:48:38] &lt;zedas&gt;  but that&#8217;d be me, so i want zmq_poll to do whatever works best</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:48:40] &lt;sustrik&gt;    yes, that&#8217;s the option</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:48:59] &lt;sustrik&gt;    the obvious problem is that there&#8217;s no POSIX standard fro epoll-style polling</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:49:24] &lt;sustrik&gt;    kqueue seems to be most neat, but still it&#8217;s hard to decide on actual API</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 26 June 2010] [02:51:48] &lt;zedas&gt;  i&#8217;ll give it a shot when i get to that part.  right after i find out why it craps out at 1024 fds</div>
