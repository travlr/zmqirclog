<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:29:22] &lt;andrewvc&gt; hey, some good news, wanted your thoughts on something</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:29:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt; so, one issue with ffi-rzmq is depending on ffi</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:19] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yeah, oruen contributed that bit</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:27] &lt;cremes&gt;   i&#8217;ll commit something similar; thanks for the idea</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:46] &lt;andrewvc&gt; he switched me off bones and onto bundler for gem releases</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:32:29] &lt;andrewvc&gt; oh? yeah it&#8217;s a bit of overkill, the skeleton is nice, the rake tasks, not so much</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:07] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yeah, I&#8217;ll throw one together this week if you like the idea</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:19] &lt;cremes&gt;   sure</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt; I&#8217;m excited with these changes it should finally be possible to just gem install and get everything you need</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:34:09] &lt;andrewvc&gt; right now dripdrop needs a custom eventmachine and libzeromq2 and maybe ffi.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:34:28] &lt;cremes&gt;   every little bit to make it easier is worthwhile</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:22] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yep, the only missing piece is probably an apt package for a current zeromq</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:47] &lt;andrewvc&gt; but that&#8217;s prolly about 2 years off :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:59] &lt;cremes&gt;   well, 0mq seems to be moving a little faster again... packages are always out of date</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:36:04] &lt;cremes&gt;   we live in a git world now</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:36:20] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yeah, someone should right an apt adapter to github</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:36:38] &lt;andrewvc&gt; or git in general I guess</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:37:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt; hmmm, that&#8217;s definitely going on my spare time ideas list</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:41:01] &lt;cremes&gt;   i think something like that exists already... but i can&#8217;t remember where i saw it :(</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:41:02] &lt;cremes&gt;   time for bed... i&#8217;ve been burning the candle at both ends lately</div>

Building a POE socket wrapper (yes i know about the anyevent/moose thingy), works great! However, when I close sockets (pub/sub tcp in same app) it crashes :/ Seems to sometimes crash in mailbox_t::send right after close(), and sometimes it can close both but then crash in kqueue::kevent_add.. Is there any known bugs regarding kqueue/freebsd/perl? I&#8217;ve tried to reproduce in C but canno</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [02:52:05] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  if it doesnt crash in close, the kevent_add crash comes right after the close() calls (waiting a bit before calling ctx-&gt;terminate()).</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [02:58:42] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  the perl unittests seems to work at least.. hrm.. gotta dig deeper i guess :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:00:35] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  the crash in send is hitting errno_assert (nbytes != -1); in mailbox_t::send</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:21:54] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  doh, ah well nothing vital there: I&#8217;ve tried to reproduce in C but cannot</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:21:55] &lt;jstrom`&gt;                      really get it to fail there..</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:37:57] &lt;sustrik&gt;  some strange freebsd quirk i assume</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:40:10] &lt;sustrik&gt;  you don&#8217;t have to reproduce it</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:40:23] &lt;sustrik&gt;  the question is why freebsd behaves in such a way</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:41:59] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  I&#8217;ll try to strip it down to a simple test case at least :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:48:59] &lt;private_meta&gt;     The term &#8220;workaround&#8221; makes me shudder every time I read or hear it...</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:52:31] &lt;sustrik&gt;  that&#8217;s often exaclty what you have to do in the case with OS bug :)</div>

Will continue until i get a working testcase, but will have to do it later today.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:07:56] &lt;private_meta&gt;     Hmm... if heartbeats are asynchroneous in both directions and heartbeat sending and receiving are made via zmq_poll on the server side, how can you make independent sending on the client side if you don&#8217;t have zmq_poll&#8217;s timeouts?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:38:02] &lt;private_meta&gt;     When using socket_t::getsockopt, the equivalent of C&#8217;s zmq_getsockopt in C++, it works if I call getsockopt in the same function as I create the socket, but fails if I give the socket pointer to a different function and request it there. It gives me an invalid argument error in the function.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:38:20] &lt;private_meta&gt;     According to the man pages, that&#8217;s &#8220;The requested option option_name is unknown, or the requested option_len or option_value is invalid, or the size of the buffer pointed to by option_value, as specified by option_len, is insufficient for storing the option value.&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:38:43] &lt;private_meta&gt;     But I call it exactly the same, I even call the same pointer, but in two different places, yet the same thread. Any idea what might be the problem there?</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [06:35:32] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  sustrik: i think i found the problem.. I was using IO::Handle to wrap the ZMQ_FD to make it select&#8217;able in POE, and i accidentally called close() on the IO::handle, which means close() on the actual FD..</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [06:37:44] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  so, not a ZMQ/freebsd problem, just buggy code on my end :)</div>
