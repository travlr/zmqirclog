<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:10:25] &lt;pieterh&gt; it was written for 2.0 to be precise</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:10:43] &lt;pieterh&gt; I flatly disagree that it did not apply, does not <em>now</em> apply to 2.1</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:10:48] &lt;pieterh&gt; that is completely wrong</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:00] &lt;sustrik&gt; i recall explicitly addressing 2.1 compatibility issues when writing it</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:12] &lt;pieterh&gt; We wrote it in August</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:29] &lt;pieterh&gt; your memory is ... curious</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:36] &lt;sustrik&gt; ah, yes, i think thr 2.1 work started back then</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:36] &lt;pieterh&gt; Check the history</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:11:51] &lt;sustrik&gt; remember the great heats in BTS?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:12] &lt;pieterh&gt; please, sustrik, check the dates when you introduced the zmq_term blocking</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:24] &lt;pieterh&gt; anyhow, this is irrelevant</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:34] &lt;sustrik&gt; yes, it was at the same time</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:35] &lt;pieterh&gt; you have a release policy and we are about to release a stable 2.1</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:41] &lt;pieterh&gt; which breaks the release policy</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:51] &lt;pieterh&gt; I&#8217;m formally against that</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:12:58] &lt;pieterh&gt; and formally asking you to respect the documented policy</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:05] &lt;sustrik&gt; i am against repeated breaking of API</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:13] &lt;sustrik&gt; 2.1.1-&gt;2.1.2</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:13] &lt;pieterh&gt; the API includes the semantics of zmq_term</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:39] &lt;sustrik&gt; well, let&#8217;s do a poll then</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:46] &lt;pieterh&gt; blocking or non-blocking?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:13:59] &lt;pieterh&gt; yes, let&#8217;s do a poll</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:14:05] &lt;sustrik&gt; default linger of 0 vs. infinite</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:14:08] &lt;pieterh&gt; indeed</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:14:44] &lt;pieterh&gt; note, you can add zmq_term_blocking () which does infinite blocking with a timeout</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:02] &lt;sustrik&gt; sure, but that&#8217;s not the point</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:06] &lt;pieterh&gt; yes it is</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:13] &lt;pieterh&gt; if people absolutely need the semantics, they are present</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:23] &lt;sustrik&gt; we are discussing backward comaptibility not new apis</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:27] &lt;pieterh&gt; ok, setting LINGER gives the same results</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:29] &lt;sustrik&gt; anyway, let&#8217;s ask people</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:37] &lt;yrashk&gt;  I vote for keeping it as is</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:39] &lt;yrashk&gt;  :)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:44] &lt;yrashk&gt;  if anybody&#8217;s interested :)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:50] &lt;sustrik&gt; i am against :)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:52] &lt;pieterh&gt; yrashk: &#8216;as is&#8217; depends where you are today</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:56] &lt;yrashk&gt;  master</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:15:57] &lt;sustrik&gt; let me ask on ml</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:16:07] &lt;pieterh&gt; could you please be specific: infinite blocking, or not</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:16:11] &lt;yrashk&gt;  infinite</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:16:11] &lt;sustrik&gt; yes</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:16:33] &lt;sustrik&gt; there are two sides to the problem</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:16:42] &lt;sustrik&gt; i&#8217;ll try to explain on the ml</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:06] &lt;pieterh&gt; sustrik: please, do point out this is for the stable 2.1 to be released shortly</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:19] &lt;pieterh&gt; and do explain that infinite blocking means all existing apps are likely to break</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:25] &lt;pieterh&gt; when they migrate from 2.0 to 2.1</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:27] &lt;sustrik&gt; 2.0 apps</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:35] &lt;sustrik&gt; in the opposite case</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:42] &lt;sustrik&gt; the 2.1 apps are going to break</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:48] &lt;sustrik&gt; i&#8217;ll explain that</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:17:56] &lt;pieterh&gt; all the ones that don&#8217;t explicitly set LINGER to zero, which is loads and loads</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:18:09] &lt;pieterh&gt; (loads and loads take the effort to set LINGER to zero)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:18:54] &lt;pieterh&gt; yes, a poll will be interesting...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:19:26] &lt;pieterh&gt; BTW there&#8217;s a line in the Release Policies page I am going to remove</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:19:32] &lt;pieterh&gt; &#8220;In general we have a stable and an unstable releases of the product, e.g. 2.0.x and 2.1.x&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:19:36] &lt;pieterh&gt; that is just wrong</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:21:22] &lt;pieterh&gt; bleh, the contract is vague for minor releases</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:21:29] &lt;pieterh&gt; &#8220;It may even run&#8221;</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:21:38] &lt;pieterh&gt; some lawyer has been editing that page...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:30:06] &lt;Guthur&gt;  is the reactor pattern still ear marked for 3.0</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:30:48] &lt;Guthur&gt;  just thinking that if it was to replace Poll it might be a good opportunity to work IOCP into the windows version</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:31:39] &lt;Guthur&gt;  which would obviously immediately open up IPC</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:32:06] &lt;pieterh&gt; Guthur: I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s on the 3.0 roadmap</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:32:38] &lt;Guthur&gt;  it is according to the website</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:33:19] &lt;Guthur&gt;  it does say replacing OR supplementing though</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:33:23] &lt;pieterh&gt; indeed, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s on the roadmap</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:33:44] &lt;Guthur&gt;  ok, is there a more up to date doc</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:34:34] &lt;pieterh&gt; sorry to be unhelpful but the only accurate doc is the NEWS when a feature&#8217;s been released</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [09:34:43] &lt;pieterh&gt; and then the man page...</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:29:07] &lt;zedas&gt;   pieterh: or write a book :-)</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:29:26] &lt;pieterh&gt; :-) yeah, that&#8217;s always a good option</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:31:14] &lt;sustrik&gt; 3.0 road map is out of date</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:31:24] &lt;sustrik&gt; :(</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:32:11] &lt;sustrik&gt; i would rather use the page to collect the API changes</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:32:25] &lt;pieterh&gt; sustrik: ctrl-e (stuff) ctrl-s</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:32:34] &lt;sustrik&gt; new features, otoh, will anyway be only those that people contribute</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:32:55] &lt;sustrik&gt; right</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:36:32] &lt;Skaag&gt;   sustrik: you heard about Sector and UDT?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:36:48] &lt;sustrik&gt; i know UDT</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:36:56] &lt;sustrik&gt; don&#8217;t know about Sector</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:37:04] &lt;Skaag&gt;   that&#8217;s the funny thing</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:37:12] &lt;Skaag&gt;   I thought about implementing a filesystem based on ZMQ</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:37:22] &lt;Skaag&gt;   and while looking for prior work, I found Sector...</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:37:42] &lt;Skaag&gt;   on paper, it looks very interesting</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:38:16] &lt;sustrik&gt; there are several distributed databases out there</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:38:25] &lt;sustrik&gt; i am not an expert in the topic though</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:38:30] &lt;Skaag&gt;   this one offers a fuse client which makes it interesting</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:38:43] &lt;Skaag&gt;   the reason I mentioned it is UDT actually</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:39:31] &lt;sustrik&gt; like in &#8220;uses UDT&#8221; fro communication between nodes, right?</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:39:36] &lt;Skaag&gt;   yes</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [10:39:46] &lt;sustrik&gt; nice</div>

<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:39:20] &lt;cremes&gt;  nadime: i have a few suggestions for things to look at</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:39:52] &lt;cremes&gt;  1. if your PUSH socket is in the same process as your &#8220;io thread PULL sockets&#8221; you should be using inproc transport instead of tcp</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:40:16] &lt;cremes&gt;  2. take a look at your message serialization; sometimes deserialization is more costly than serialization</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:40:38] &lt;cremes&gt;  however, i assume you are sending packed structures so you are probably just casting a pointer to get to your data</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:41:21] &lt;cremes&gt;  3. instrument your messages so that you can measure how many nano/micro/milliseconds it takes for the PUSH to deliver to the PULL socket</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [18:42:14] &lt;cremes&gt;  4. instrument the messages that go from the &#8220;server io threads&#8221; to the &#8220;client io threads&#8221; via PUB/SUB to measure latency</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:04:32] &lt;nadime&gt;  i am using inproc for anything local, cremes</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:04:42] &lt;nadime&gt;  the only thing i use tcp for is external</div>
<div class="line">[Saturday 12 March 2011] [19:05:41] &lt;nadime&gt;  thanks for the suggestions, re: instrumentation</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:53:46] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      well, sustrik if not I was just wondering if you have considered the use of a pipe... I&#8217;ve used them in the past, and one nice thing about them is that a non-blocking pipe write (up to a defined limit) is atomic, it either goes trough entirely or fail, whihc I feel is what the current problem was with making sockets non-blocking...</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:55:26] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      POSIX.1-2001  says  that write(2)s of less than PIPE_BUF bytes must be atomic: the output data is written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence. [...] O_NONBLOCK enabled, n &lt;= PIPE_BUF: If there is room to write n bytes to the pipe, then write(2) succeeds immediately, writing all n bytes; otherwise write(2) fails, with errno set to EAGAIN.</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:56:54] &lt;sustrik&gt;   dermoth: is pipe different from a socket pair in this respect?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:58:53] &lt;sustrik&gt;   the nice thing at least is that pipe is unidirectional rather than bidrectional</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:59:07] &lt;sustrik&gt;   meaning it will consume less buffer memory</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [02:59:16] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      sustrik, I have little experience with sockets, but afaik a non-blocking write can he partial and there&#8217;s no threshold for atomicity. OTOH  POSIX.1-2001 says that anything less than or equal to PIPE_BUF must be written atomically. IIRC it also defines PIPE_BUF be at least 512 bytes, iirc in Linux it&#8217;s 4096 though...</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 14 March 2011] [03:00:45] &lt;dermoth|home&gt;      as with above, from &#8220;man 7 pipe&#8221; on Ubuntu: POSIX.1-2001 requires PIPE_BUF to be at least 512 bytes.  (On Linux, PIPE_BUF  is  4096 bytes.)</div>
