<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:29:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt; so, one issue with ffi-rzmq is depending on ffi</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:19] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yeah, oruen contributed that bit</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:27] &lt;cremes&gt;   i&#8217;ll commit something similar; thanks for the idea</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:31:46] &lt;andrewvc&gt; he switched me off bones and onto bundler for gem releases</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:32:29] &lt;andrewvc&gt; oh? yeah it&#8217;s a bit of overkill, the skeleton is nice, the rake tasks, not so much</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:07] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yeah, I&#8217;ll throw one together this week if you like the idea</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:19] &lt;cremes&gt;   sure</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:33:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt; I&#8217;m excited with these changes it should finally be possible to just gem install and get everything you need</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:34:09] &lt;andrewvc&gt; right now dripdrop needs a custom eventmachine and libzeromq2 and maybe ffi.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:34:28] &lt;cremes&gt;   every little bit to make it easier is worthwhile</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:22] &lt;andrewvc&gt; yep, the only missing piece is probably an apt package for a current zeromq</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:47] &lt;andrewvc&gt; but that&#8217;s prolly about 2 years off :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:35:59] &lt;cremes&gt;   well, 0mq seems to be moving a little faster again... packages are always out of date</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:36:04] &lt;cremes&gt;   we live in a git world now</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:36:38] &lt;andrewvc&gt; or git in general I guess</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:37:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt; hmmm, that&#8217;s definitely going on my spare time ideas list</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [00:41:01] &lt;cremes&gt;   i think something like that exists already... but i can&#8217;t remember where i saw it :(</div>

Building a POE socket wrapper (yes i know about the anyevent/moose thingy), works great! However, when I close sockets (pub/sub tcp in same app) it crashes :/ Seems to sometimes crash in mailbox_t::send right after close(), and sometimes it can close both but then crash in kqueue::kevent_add.. Is there any known bugs regarding kqueue/freebsd/perl? I&#8217;ve tried to reproduce in C but canno</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [02:52:05] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  if it doesnt crash in close, the kevent_add crash comes right after the close() calls (waiting a bit before calling ctx-&gt;terminate()).</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [02:58:42] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  the perl unittests seems to work at least.. hrm.. gotta dig deeper i guess :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:00:35] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  the crash in send is hitting errno_assert (nbytes != -1); in mailbox_t::send</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:21:54] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  doh, ah well nothing vital there: I&#8217;ve tried to reproduce in C but cannot</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:37:57] &lt;sustrik&gt;  some strange freebsd quirk i assume</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:41:59] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  I&#8217;ll try to strip it down to a simple test case at least :)</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:48:59] &lt;private_meta&gt;     The term &#8220;workaround&#8221; makes me shudder every time I read or hear it...</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [03:52:31] &lt;sustrik&gt;  that&#8217;s often exaclty what you have to do in the case with OS bug :)</div>

Will continue until i get a working testcase, but will have to do it later today.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:07:56] &lt;private_meta&gt;     Hmm... if heartbeats are asynchroneous in both directions and heartbeat sending and receiving are made via zmq_poll on the server side, how can you make independent sending on the client side if you don&#8217;t have zmq_poll&#8217;s timeouts?</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:38:02] &lt;private_meta&gt;     When using socket_t::getsockopt, the equivalent of C&#8217;s zmq_getsockopt in C++, it works if I call getsockopt in the same function as I create the socket, but fails if I give the socket pointer to a different function and request it there. It gives me an invalid argument error in the function.</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [04:38:43] &lt;private_meta&gt;     But I call it exactly the same, I even call the same pointer, but in two different places, yet the same thread. Any idea what might be the problem there?</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [06:35:32] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  sustrik: i think i found the problem.. I was using IO::Handle to wrap the ZMQ_FD to make it select&#8217;able in POE, and i accidentally called close() on the IO::handle, which means close() on the actual FD..</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 01 March 2011] [06:37:44] &lt;jstrom`&gt;  so, not a ZMQ/freebsd problem, just buggy code on my end :)</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 March 2011] [07:56:24] &lt;pieterh&gt; as maintainer, I&#8217;ll accept <em>perfect</em> patches from anyone I trust</div>

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 March 2011] [07:58:58] &lt;ianbarber&gt;       in that process there must be an agent who wants a patch from &lt;new version&gt; in &lt;maintenance version&gt; and is willing to do the work to test and submit the perfect patch.

<div class="line">[Thursday 03 March 2011] [07:59:28] &lt;ianbarber&gt;       and the people that are on the older versions don&#8217;t necessarily have the awareness that there are improvements that would benefit them</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:41] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  have a single thread that handles all messages on a single socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:41:45] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  and delegate to worker processes</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:42:12] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  that, or spawn one socket per thread</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:43:43] &lt;engwan&gt;    hmm.. but i tried just spawning one thread.. and it still segfaults</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:01] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  hmmm, if the thread is different than the one that created the socket, you may still have issues</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:08] &lt;engwan&gt;    my loader forks/execs then creates the socket</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:15] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  ohhhhhhhhhh</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:25] &lt;engwan&gt;    without fork</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:27] &lt;engwan&gt;    it works</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:30] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, exactly</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:41] &lt;pieterh&gt;   sockets are not thread safe</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:44:42] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  I&#8217;ve found that requiring ffi-rzmq before forking does not work</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:06] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  each process will need its own context anyway</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  still, you should have one socket per thread</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:45:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  or just have an IO dedicated thread that handles a single socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:46:05] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you can even use eventmachine for that with em-zeromq</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:46:35] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  though, I with a low number of sockets there&#8217;s not much benefit</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:50:08] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  pieterh: does that advice make sense for you? Would you go one socket per worker, or just spawn a single thread reading off the sock and delegating to workers</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:50:16] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  in a multi-threaded up</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:52:18] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  I tend to think inproc isn&#8217;t so good in ruby, as there&#8217;s a serialization cost. In C you can just stuff a struct in one, in ruby you have to serialize/deserialize</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:52:32] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, each thread handles a separate HTTP request using rails</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:52:42] &lt;engwan&gt;    I&#8217;m just creating an easier way to create lots of rails processes connecting to mongrel2</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:13] &lt;pieterh&gt;   engwan: ok, so give each thread its own context</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:43] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  i mean, as I understand it, ZMQ will round-robin requests to various workers</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  so you want the workers pulling work, not getting it pushed to them, ideally</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:53:58] &lt;engwan&gt;    you were right andrewvc regarding the require thing</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:04] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  ah, cool, glad I could help</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:35] &lt;engwan&gt;    yeah, im not pushing work to the workers, rather the workers themselves connect to mongrel2 and ask for work</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:41] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you could either use the router/dealer stuff for that, or the easy way would be just to use a ruby construct to pull the work</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:46] &lt;pieterh&gt;   engwan: sounds fine, where are you creating the context?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:54:53] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, I&#8217;m not nuts about that part of mongrel2</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:01] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  since it uses a PUSH socket</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:06] &lt;engwan&gt;    i created the context after forking</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:13] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  PUSH has no backpressure right pieter?</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:16] &lt;pieterh&gt;   so as far as zeromq is concerned, this should all be safe</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:21] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  so, a slow worker will get equal work, correct</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:55:48] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  yeah, so engwan, I think that&#8217;s kind of a design deficiency in mongrel2</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:56:02] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  in that a slow worker will queue messages, even while others are free</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:56:16] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  you could mitigate this in your handler by implementing your own global queue</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [05:57:01] &lt;engwan&gt;    oh, so these workers listen to the socket and receive zeromq messages, plainly round robin?</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:13:35] &lt;cremes&gt;    so, i think i found the problem; it requires a change to an api &#8216;contract&#8217; in ffi-rzmq</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:14:17] &lt;cremes&gt;    right now when you call #send it handles calling Message#close for you</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:15:00] &lt;cremes&gt;    zmqmachine has a #send_messages method that automatically sets the right flags for multi-part messages, etc</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:17:22] &lt;cremes&gt;    take a look at the logic for #write:  <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/859387">https://gist.github.com/859387</a></div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:17:47] &lt;cremes&gt;    if the call to send_messages returns a failure, it keeps the messages on the internal queue and</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:09] &lt;cremes&gt;    tries to resend them in 10ms</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:33] &lt;cremes&gt;    however, the only way this would fail is if at least one part of a multi-part message failed</div>
<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:18:55] &lt;cremes&gt;    but any parts <em>before</em> that one already had Message#close called on them</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:19:25] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  how does one part of a multipart fail?</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:19:30] &lt;cremes&gt;    i don&#8217;t know</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:20:14] &lt;cremes&gt;    regardless, changing the contract for Socket#send moves the api a little closer back to the C version</div>

<div class="line">[Monday 07 March 2011] [17:24:59] &lt;andrewvc&gt;  maybe we could deprecate it somehow</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:32:09] &lt;andrewvc&gt; it looks like exceptions that don&#8217;t get handled cause mutex to complain that it now won&#8217;t get unlocked.</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:32:18] &lt;andrewvc&gt; does that sound right, or am I misunderstanding this?</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:32:53] &lt;engwan&gt;   so it gave out that exception</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:33:52] &lt;andrewvc&gt; I was thinking what I said didn&#8217;t quite made sense</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:35:41] &lt;andrewvc&gt; we&#8217;re going to require that you manually close any sent messages after the send</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:36:29] &lt;andrewvc&gt; basically, here&#8217;s the deal</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:37:27] &lt;andrewvc&gt; lets say you&#8217;re sending a multi-part message</div>

<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:38:32] &lt;andrewvc&gt; then lets say you try and resend the message, starting from part 1</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:00] &lt;andrewvc&gt; well, #send has modified those Message objects, they&#8217;ve been closed, so you can&#8217;t resend part 1 and 2</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:06] &lt;andrewvc&gt; you have to recreate the Message objects</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:23] &lt;andrewvc&gt; what you really want to do is send all 4, then close all 4, not send each, closing them one at a time as you go</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:29] &lt;engwan&gt;   ohh.. yeah, that makes sense..</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:39:55] &lt;andrewvc&gt; though, something still seems odd about it to me, maybe there&#8217;s a better way</div>
<div class="line">[Tuesday 08 March 2011] [01:40:10] &lt;andrewvc&gt; though, the other thing we discussed was renaming send, as it conflicts with Object#send</div>

<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:25:39] &lt;guido_g&gt;   tested means compiled and used in a program w/o problems</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:28:02] &lt;guido_g&gt;   and now for the ml again</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:30:07] &lt;pieterh&gt;   ok, applied to 2-0 and 2-1</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:30:26] &lt;guido_g&gt;   and sent to the ml</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:30:49] &lt;guido_g&gt;   i should really become more patient</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:31:40] &lt;pieterh&gt;   nah, we release maintainers just have to make sure to ask the right questions</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:33:18] &lt;guido_g&gt;   btw, why did you disable multicast loop in 2.1?</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:33:41] &lt;pieterh&gt;   Steve-o&#8217;s contribution</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:35:08] &lt;guido_g&gt;   should be mentioned at a prominent place in the release notes, because it will break single-box testing</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:35:39] &lt;pieterh&gt;   there was iirc some discussion of this on the list, let me check...</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:38:57] &lt;pieterh&gt;   there is some discussion about a week ago but tbh I&#8217;m not following it totally</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:39:00] &lt;guido_g&gt;   yes, but everyone is reading the ml or remembers all topics going on there</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:39:08] &lt;guido_g&gt;   <em>but *not</em></div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:39:24] &lt;pieterh&gt;   yes, I meant just for us, now, to understand this</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:39:43] &lt;pieterh&gt;   afaics Steve says multicast loop doesn&#8217;t work on Linux and lo is lossy</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:40:40] &lt;guido_g&gt;   going to read the patch...</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:44:53] &lt;guido_g&gt;   seems like the socket optoin for multicast loopback is turned off, nothing to w/ the lo interface</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:45:14] &lt;pieterh&gt;   I&#8217;d suggest asking Steve, on the ml, where he posted the patch, what the rationale is</div>
<div class="line">[Friday 11 March 2011] [06:46:55] &lt;guido_g&gt;   ok</div>
